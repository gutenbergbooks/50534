and constitutes one of its most interesting and attractive features.
The Edition from which the present is translated was brought me from
Paris by a distinguished defender of Civil and Religious Liberty: and
as my friend had an anxiety from a thorough conviction of its interest
and value, to see it published in the English Language, I have from
like feelings brought it before the public; and I am convinced that it
is an excellent antidote to Superstition and Intolerance, and eminently
calculated to promote the cause of Freedom, Justice, and Morality.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The Translator of the following little treatise
deems it necessary to say a few words as to the object of its
publication. It is given to the world, neither with a view to advocate
Scepticism, nor to spread infidelity, but simply to vindicate the right
of private judgment. No human being is in a position to look into the
heart, or to decide correctly as to the creed or conduct of his fellow
mortals; and the attributes of the Deity are so far beyond the grasp of
limited reason, that man must become a God himself before he can
comprehend them. Such being the case, surely all harsh censure of each
other&rsquo;s opinions and actions ought to be abandoned; and every one
should so train himself as to be enabled to declare with the humane and
manly philosopher</p>

<p class="par first">It has long been a disputed point if there was at
anytime a book printed and bearing the title of &ldquo;The Three
Impostors.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">M. de la Monnoye, having been informed that a learned
German<a class="noteref" id="xd21e213src" href="#xd21e213" name=
"xd21e213src">1</a> intended to publish a <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e216" title="Source: disertation">dissertation</span> the object
of which was to prove that this work had really been printed, wrote a
letter, in refutation, to one of his friends; this letter was given by
M. Bayle to M. Basnage de Bauval, who in February 1694, gave an extract
from it in his &ldquo;History of the works of celebrated and learned
men.&rdquo; At a later period M. de la Monnoye entered more fully into
the subject, in a letter dated at Paris 16th of June, 1712, and
addressed to President Bouhier, in which letter, he says, will be found
an abridged but complete account of this remarkable book.</p>

says, is apparent from the letters of Pierre des Vignes, the secretary
and chancellor of the second Frederick, and from Matthew Paris;
inasmuch as they record, that this monarch was blamed for having said
that the world had been led aside by &ldquo;Three Impostors;&rdquo; but
by no means that he had written a book having such a title. The Emperor
denied in the strongest terms, that he ever made use of any expression
to that effect. He detested the blasphemy with which they charged him,
and declared that it was an atrocious calumny; more shame to Lipsius
and other writers who have condemned him without sufficiently looking

<p class="par">Now we must turn to an author, name unknown, but accused
of blasphemy against Jesus Christ. The charge was founded upon some
papers discovered at Geneva in 1547, amongst the documents belonging to
M. Gruet. An Italian, named Fausto da Longiano, had begun a work which
he entitled &ldquo;The Temple of Truth,&rdquo; in which he undertakes
no less than to overturn all religions. &ldquo;I have,&rdquo; he says,
&ldquo;begun another work entitled &lsquo;The Temple of Truth.&rsquo;

this work. Perhaps it had never been written, and although it had been
published, it must have been a very different book from the one in
question; of which, they pretend that there are some copies in the
libraries in Germany, printed in folio, and written in High Dutch.</p>
<p class="par">Claude Beauregard, better known under his Latin

Giordano Bruno who was burned at Rome, 17th Feb. 1600, was accused of
having advanced something much to the same effect. But although
Beauregard and Bruno have indulged in such reveries, and have thought
proper to assert that they quoted from the work in question, is this a
certain proof that they had read the book? If so they would doubtless
have stated whether it was in manuscript, or in print, and referred to
the size and the place where they found it.</p>
<p class="par">Tentzelius, trusting to one of his friends, a pretended
ocular witness, gives a description of the book, and specifies the

religions, he gives as examples Moses, Jesus Christ, and Mahomet.
<span class="corr" id="xd21e317" title=

<p class="par">A journalist at Leipsic, in his &ldquo;<i lang="la">acta
eruditarum</i>,&rdquo; dated Jan. 1709, pp. 36 and 37, gives the
following extract from a letter addressed to him: &ldquo;Having
occasion to be in Saxony I saw, in the Library of M..., a book entitled
&ldquo;The Three Impostors.&rdquo; It is an 8vo volume, in Latin,
without the name of the printer or the date of its publication; but to
judge from the letter it appears to have been published in Germany. It
was to no purpose that I tried to obtain permission to read the whole
work. The proprietor of the book, a man of sensitive piety, would not
consent to it. I have since learned that a celebrated professor at
Stuttgard had offered a great sum of money for the volume. Shortly
afterwards I went to Nuremberg, and in talking of this work to M. Andre
Mylhdorf, a man respectable alike for his age, and from his learning,
he assured me he had read it, and that M. Wolfer a clergyman had lent
it to him. From the manner in which he spoke, I thought it might be a
copy of the one alluded <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href=
"#pb12" name="pb12">12</a>]</span>to above, and I concluded that it was
unquestionably the book referred to; but not that it was in octavo, nor
of so old a date, nor perhaps so accurate.&rdquo; The writer of the
foregoing was able to throw more light upon the subject and ought to
have done so; for it is not enough to say that he had seen the
book&mdash;he must produce evidence that he had seen it, otherwise he
ought to be classed with those who promulgate opinions founded on mere
report; in which category we must include all the authors to whom
reference is made in this disquisition.</p>
<p class="par">The first who makes mention of the book as it existed in
1543, is William Postel, in his treatise on the agreement of the
Alcoran with the doctrines of the Lutherans or the Evangelists. He
calls the work &ldquo;<i>Anevangelistes</i>,&rdquo; and attempts in it
to bring the Lutheran doctrines into utter disrepute by proving that
they lead straightway to Atheism. To support his argument he instances
three or four productions written, as he says, by Atheists, whom he
declares to have been the first disciples of this new Gospel. He adds,
&ldquo;my opinion can be vindicated by reference to an infamous
pamphlet written by Villanovanus relative to three works respectively
entitled &lsquo;The Cymbal of the World,&rsquo;
&lsquo;Pantagruel,&rsquo; and the &lsquo;New Islands;&rsquo; the
authors of which works were the standard-bearers of the Atheistical
party.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">This Villanovanus, whom Postel asserts to be the author
of the book &ldquo;The Three <span class="corr" id="xd21e334" title=
"Source: Imposters">Impostors</span>,&rdquo; was Michel Servetus the
son of a notary, born in 1509, at Villanueva in Aragon, who assumed the
name of Villanovanus, in a preface to a Bible which was printed for him
at Lyons, 1542, by Hugues de la Porte. In France his designation was
Villeneuve, under which title he was impeached, after he had published
at Vienna, in Dauphiny, 1553, (the year before his death) the work
<span class="corr" id="xd21e337" title=
"Source: entituled">entitled</span> &ldquo;Christianity
restored;&rdquo; a book extremely rare, on account of the trouble which
they took at Geneva to find out the copies of the work and get them
burned. In the authentic list of the writings of Servetus, however, we
do not find mention made of &ldquo;The Three Impostors.&rdquo; Neither
Calvin nor Beza, nor Alexander Morus, nor any other defender of the
Huguenot party who wrote against Servetus, and whose interest it was to
justify his punishment, and to convict him of having written this work,
has <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href="#pb13" name=
"pb13">13</a>]</span>laid it to his charge. Postel, an ex-Jesuit, was
the first to do so, without grounds.</p>
<p class="par">Florimond de Remond, a councillor in the Senate at
Bordeaux, writes decidedly that he had seen this book in print. His
words are; &ldquo;James Curio, in his Chronology 1556, asserts that the
Palatinate was filled with scoffers at religion, the Lievanistes, viz.
a sect who considered the Sacred Writings as fabulous, and more
especially those of Moses, the great Lawgiver of God. Is there not a
book, &lsquo;The Three Impostors,&rsquo; defaming the three religions
which alone acknowledge the true God&mdash;the Jewish, the Christian,
and the Mahometan?&mdash;a book composed in Germany, but printed
elsewhere at the exact moment when these heretics are employing this
individual to spread abroad their doctrines? The very title shows the
character of the age which has dared to publish so impious a treatise.
I would have referred to it unless Osius and Genebrard had spoken to me
on the subject. I recollect that in my earlier days I saw a copy of
this work at the College of Presle. It belonged to Ramus, a man
distinguished for his extraordinary learning, and who was then employed
in deep researches into the mysteries connected with religious belief;
which subject he intended to treat in a philosophical manner. At this
time they were circulating this iniquitous work amongst the learned,
who were very desirous to see it.&rdquo; A curious inquirer into
secrets!</p>
<p class="par">Everybody knows Florimond de Remond as an insignificant
scribbler. There are three remarkable sayings in currency against him;
that &ldquo;he built without money, that he was a judge without
principle, and an author without knowledge.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e346src" href="#xd21e346" name="xd21e346src">9</a>&rdquo; We know
also that he always lent his name to P. Richeaume, a Jesuite much hated
by the Protestants, who cloaked his own name by assuming that of the
councillor of Bordeaux. Now, if Osius and Genebrard had spoken as
decidedly as Florimond de Remond, there might have been somewhat to
rest upon; but see what Genebrard says in the thirty-ninth page of his
answer to Lambert Danan, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href=
"#pb14" name="pb14">14</a>]</span>printed (octavo) at Paris
1581.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e351src" href="#xd21e351" name=
"xd21e351src">10</a> &ldquo;They (his own party) have not driven
Blandratus, nor Alciatus, nor Ochinus into Mahometanism; nor have they
induced Valleus to profess himself an Atheist; neither have they
enticed any one whatever to circulate the work called &ldquo;The Three
Impostors,&rdquo; wherein Christ the Lord is alluded to as the second,
the other two being Moses and Mahomet.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Is that the way to <span class="corr" id="xd21e357"
title="Source: identifiy">identify</span> this impious book? and
Genebrard, forsooth had seen it! And can it be, that in the present day
people will attempt to get up regular proof to show that such a work
exists? It is a well known fact that, in all ages, many lies have been
palmed off in reference to books which could never be discovered,
although individuals declare that they had seen them and even went so
far as to mention the places where they had been favoured with their
perusal.</p>
<p class="par">It has been said that this work was in the library of M.
Salvius, the Swedish ambassador, at Munster, and that Queen
<span class="corr" id="xd21e362" title=
"Source: Christiana">Christina</span>, unwilling to ask it of him while
he lived, immediately sent M. Bourdelet, her chief physician, to
entreat his widow to satisfy her curiosity, when he was informed that
M. Salvius, having been <span class="corr" id="xd21e365" title=
"Source: siezed">seized</span> with remorse of conscience on the night
of his death, made them burn the work in his presence. A short time
afterwards Christiana enquired eagerly after the &ldquo;<i lang=
"la">Colloquium <span class="corr" id="xd21e370" title=
"Source: Heptaphlomers">Heptaplomers</span></i>&rdquo; by Bodin, a
manuscript, at that period extremely rare; after a long search it was
found, but whatever desire the Queen had to see the work in question,
and although it was sought after in all the libraries of Europe, she
died without having discovered it. Ought we not therefore to conclude
that it was never in existence? Without doubt the pains taken by
Christina would have led to the discovery of that book which Postel
declares was printed in 1543, and which Florimond de Remond says
appeared in 1556. Since then different individuals have assigned to it
other dates. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15" name=

<p class="par">In 1654, Jean Baptiste Morin, a celebrated doctor and
mathematician, wrote a letter under the name of Vincent Panurge, which
he addressed to himself in this way, &ldquo;An epistle to that most
eminent physician, John Baptist Morin, concerning the &lsquo;Three
Impostors<span class="corr" id="xd21e376" title=
"Not in source">&rsquo;</span>.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e379src"
href="#xd21e379" name="xd21e379src">11</a>&rdquo; The three impostors
to whom he refers were Gassendi, Neure, and Bernier, whom he wished to
satirize under this title. Christian Kortholt in 1680 employed the same
terms in his work against Hebert, Hobbes, and Spinoza. Such has been
the use which the learned have made of this work when they wrote
against their opponents, and in this way have they drawn upon the
credulity of comparatively ignorant people, who, caring little to
examine the evidences, have been deceived at once. Is it possible, that
if such a work had really existed, it would not have been refuted; just
as they refuted the work concerning the Pre-Adamites,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e382src" href="#xd21e382" name="xd21e382src">12</a> written by
M. de la Peyrere,&mdash;the discourses of Spinoza, and the publications
of Bodin? The &ldquo;Colloquium Heptaplomeres,&rdquo; although in
manuscript, has been answered; would &ldquo;The Three Impostors&rdquo;
have met with more favour? How comes it that it has not been condemned,
and placed in the Index Expurgatorius, and how has it escaped cremation
by the hands of the common hangman? Books against morality have been
sometimes tolerated, but those which strongly attack Religion do not
escape with impunity. Florimond de Remond, who says that he had seen
the book, asserts <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href="#pb16"
name="pb16">16</a>]</span>that he was at that time a youth, old enough
perhaps to write fairy tales; he quotes Ramus who had been dead for
thirty years, and could not convict him of falsehood; he quotes Osius
and Genebrard, but in in vague terms, and without pointing out the
passage in their works. He says that they were circulating this
work&mdash;a work which if it existed, would unquestionably have been
put under lock and key. Our opponents may produce a passage from Sir
Thomas Browne, who, in the 19th sec. part I. of his work styled
&ldquo;Religio Medici,&rdquo; translated from English into Latin by a
distinguished scholar, uses the following words; &ldquo;this impious
man, the author of this blasphemous work, <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e402" title="Source: &ldquo;">&lsquo;</span>The Three
Impostors,&rsquo; although a stranger to every religion, inasmuch as he
was neither a Jew, a Mahometan, nor a Christian, was nevertheless
evidently not an Atheist.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e406src" href=
"#xd21e406" name="xd21e406src">13</a>&rdquo; From this they would infer
that he must have seen the book, when he speaks in such terms of its
author. Now, Sir Thomas only says that Bernard Ochinus, who in his
opinion was the author of the work, (as he hints in a foot note,) was
more of a Deist than an Atheist, and that any Deist of ordinary average
intellect and information, was capable of planning and executing such a
design. Molikius, in a note upon the passage, denies and justly, that
this work was written by Ochinus, for they assert that it was written
in Latin, and we know that Ochinus never wrote but in Italian; moreover
if he had been suspected of having any connection with this work, his
enemies, who made so much clamour against his dialogues concerning the
Trinity and Polygamy, would not have spared him. But how can we
reconcile Browne and Genebrard who consider Ochinus as a Mahometan, and
at the same time declare that he was neither a disciple of Moses, nor
of Jesus Christ, nor of Mahomet!</p>
<p class="par">Naude, by a strange mistake attributes the work to
Villeneuve, a comparatively ignorant writer, and Ernstius declares that
at Rome he had learned from Campannelle, that Muret, a polished and
accomplished author, had written the work <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb17" href="#pb17" name="pb17">17</a>]</span>more than two centuries
after Villaneuve. Ernstius is mistaken. Campannelle also refutes
himself, for in the preface to his work, &ldquo;Atheism <span class=
"corr" id="xd21e413" title=
"Source: overthown">overthrown</span>,&rdquo; and still more explicitly
in his discourse, &ldquo;Paganism indefensible,&rdquo; he affirms that
this work came from Germany, but that it was the composition of Muret;
a statement entirely opposite to that of Florimond de Remond alluded to
before, which holds that the work was written in Germany but published
elsewhere. Muret has therefore been falsely accused, and stands in need
of no apology. They have judged of his religion from his life. The
Huguenot party, vexed that after embracing their doctrines he had
abandoned them forever, did not spare him on this occasion, and Beza,
in his &ldquo;Ecclesiastical History,<span class="corr" id="xd21e416"
title="Source: &rsquo;">&rdquo;</span> reproaches him with two crimes,
the second being Atheism. Julius Scaliger, nettled by a <i lang=
"fr">jeu d&rsquo;esprit</i> of Muret&rsquo;s against him, has been led
to do him injustice<a class="noteref" id="xd21e422src" href="#xd21e422"
name="xd21e422src">14</a>. &ldquo;Muret,&rdquo; he says maliciously,
&ldquo;would have been a better Christian if he had believed in God; I
am aware that he tried to persuade others to do so.&rdquo; In this way
have originated false impressions against Muret. Instead of respecting
his exemplary piety, of which he gave striking evidence in the last
years of his existence, they set themselves half a century after his
death, to blacken his character by accusing him of crimes which were
unknown to his most avowed enemies, and with which, in his life-time,
we are certain that he never was charged. Some ignorant writers who
possess no critical acumen, have impeached without any reason whatever
the first individual who occurred to their memory. Stephen Dolet of
Orleans, Frances Pucci of Florence, John Milton of London, and Merula,
a renegade Mahometan, have done so; they have accused Peter Aretin,
merely because he was a fearless and licentious writer, without
reflecting that he was an uncultivated man, of no learning and scarcely
master of his native tongue. For similar reasons they have blamed
Poggio and others, and have even gone so far back as Boccaccio, most
likely on account of the third tale in his Decameron, where he recounts
the fable of three similar rings, of which he makes a dangerous
application to the Jewish, Christian, and Mahometan religions, as if
insinuating <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18" name=
"pb18">18</a>]</span>that they might be embraced indifferently, since
it was impossible to decide which of them ought to have the preference.
Neither have these writers forgot <span class="corr" id="xd21e431"

Rabelais. The Dutchman also who translates into French the
&ldquo;Religio Medici&rdquo; of Sir Thomas Browne, in the notes to his

<p class="par">With more apparent reason they attack both <span class=
"corr" id="xd21e436" title="Source: Pomponacius">Pompanacius</span> and
Cardan. The former, in his treatise on the immortality of the soul,
where he reasons as a philosopher and speaks abstractly of the Catholic
faith&mdash;in which (at the end of his work) he solemnly professes
himself a believer&mdash;is bold enough to add that the doctrine of the
immortality of the soul had been propounded by the <span class="corr"
id="xd21e439" title="Source: orignators">originators</span> of every
religious creed in order to keep their followers in thrall, and that
therefore the majority of the human race had been duped. &ldquo;If the
Jewish, Christian, and Mahometan religions,&rdquo; he continues,
&ldquo;are all three of them impostures, it follows that the half of
mankind are mistaken.&rdquo; This absurd reasoning, in spite of the
precautions of <span class="corr" id="xd21e442" title=

and induced him to exclaim, &ldquo;Can any thing be conceived of more

<p class="par">Cardan goes still farther wrong in the eleventh of his
discourses &ldquo;On Sophistry,&rdquo; where, after minutely comparing
Paganism, Judaism, Christianity, and Mahometanism, and setting the one
to contradict the other, without expressing belief in any of them, he
finishes rashly in this way; &ldquo;<span lang="la">his igitur arbitrio
victori&aelig; relictes</span>,&rdquo; that is, he leaves it to chance
to decide the victory; an expression however which he himself corrected
in the second edition of his work.&mdash;This retraction did not save
him from being most bitterly attacked three years afterward by Joseph
Scaliger, on account of the fearful import of the language he had made
use of, and of the indifference it showed on the part of Cardan as to
which of the four parties might gain the victory, and as to whether
that victory were gained by argument or arms. <span class=

<p class="par">In the last article of the work &ldquo;Naudiana,&rdquo;
which is a rhapsodical compound of blunders and falsehood, there are
some confused references to &ldquo;The Three Impostors.&rdquo; The
author asserts that Ramus had attributed it to Postel; nothing whatever
can be found in the writings of Ramus to establish this. Postel was a
singular visionary. Henry Stephanus relates that he had been heard to
say, that out of the three religions, the Jewish, the Christian, and
the Mahometan, a good one might be made. However, in no part of his
work does he call in question the mission of Moses, or the divinity of
Christ; neither does he venture to maintain in exact terms that the
devout Venetian Hospitaller, whom he calls &ldquo;his mother
Jeanne,&rdquo; would be the Redeemer of women, as Christ had been the
Redeemer of men. After explaining that in men there is a masculine
part, the <i>animus</i>, and a feminine part, the <i>anima</i>, he has
the absurdity to add that both parts were corrupted by sin and that
&ldquo;his mother Jeanne&rdquo; might restore the feminine as Christ
had restored the masculine. The book in which he utters this absurdity
was printed at Paris in 1553, and is by no means so rare but that
copies may easily be found. From it we can gather that he would have
published the other works also, if it had been true that he had reached
this pitch of blasphemy. So far from this being the case, he writes
(1543) that the book was written by Michael Servetus; and long
afterwards he does not scruple to avenge himself on his Huguenot
calumniators, by accusing them, in a letter addressed to Masius, (1563)
of having themselves printed the work at Caen: &ldquo;this infamous
commentary or discourse against Moses, Christ, and Mahomet, was lately
printed at C&aelig;n, by those who profess themselves the keenest
supporters of the Calvinistic doctrines.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e465src" href="#xd21e465" name="xd21e465src">16</a>&rdquo; In the
same chapter of &ldquo;Naudiana,&rdquo; mention is made of one Barnaud,
but in terms so perplexed that little can be drawn from them except
that he had seen an octavo work of 98 pages, printed in 1613, entitled
&ldquo;The Geneva Booby.&rdquo; It did not bear where it had been
printed, neither was the author&rsquo;s name <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20" name="pb20">20</a>]</span>given.
Perhaps it might have been written by Henri de Sponde, <span class=
"corr" id="xd21e470" title="Source: aferwards">afterwards</span> Bishop
of Pamier; who says, that at that period there lived a physician named
Barnaud an Arian, who had composed this treatise. Now this would make
it of a comparatively recent date. The only sensible article in
&ldquo;Naudiana&rdquo; is towards its conclusion, where Naude, a man of
vast experience as a bibliologist, is made to declare that he had never
seen the work alluded to, that he did not believe such a work had ever
been printed, and that he considered every thing which had been said on
this subject as mere invention and fable.</p>
<p class="par">To this list may be added that notable atheist Julius
C&aelig;sar Vanini, burned at Toulouse under the name of Lucilius
Vaninus, who was accused of having circulated this vile work in France
some years before he was put to death.</p>
<p class="par">If there are writers so credulous and devoid of common
sense as to believe in these incoherencies, asserting that the book was
publicly sold in many quarters of Europe, they ought to set the matter
at rest by producing a single copy; for it cannot be in the case
supposed, that the work is so rarely to be met with. But no person has
seen a copy, neither of the edition said to have been published by
Christian Wechel at Paris, about the middle of the 16th century, nor of
that which they attribute to Nachtegal, as printed at the Hague, 1614
or 1615. Father Theophylus Reynaud states that the former had sunk into
extreme poverty from the visitations of heaven; and Muller relates of
the latter that he was banished from the Hague with infamy. Bayle in
his dictionary (article <i>Wechell</i>) clearly refutes the calumny
against this printer; and in regard to <span class="corr" id="xd21e480"
title="Source: Natchtegal">Nachtegal</span>, Spizelius informs us that
he was a native of Alkmaer, and banished, not for having published this
suppositious work, but for having given utterance to other blasphemies.
Now, when we look over with attention and patience what Vincent
Placcius says in the folio edition of his immense work concerning
&ldquo;Anonymous writers, and authors who write under false
names,&rdquo; and what Christian Kertholt says in his work revised by
his son Sebastian regarding &ldquo;The Three Impostors,&rdquo; and
finally what Struvius advances in his treatise (1706) on &ldquo;Learned
Impostors,&rdquo; we can find nothing at all to prove that such a work
ever existed; and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href="#pb21"
name="pb21">21</a>]</span>it is astonishing that Struvius, who in spite
of the most specious evidence which Tentzelius had offered him to prove
its existence, had always maintained the contrary, was at last
persuaded to believe that there really was such a work; and that too,
for the most frivolous reason which it is possible to conceive.</p>
<p class="par">In the preface of &ldquo;Atheism Overthrown,&rdquo; he
discovers that the author of this work, in order to vindicate himself
from the crime laid to his charge, declares that &ldquo;The Three
Impostors&rdquo; had been published thirty years before he was born.
This is a strange discovery, but it appeared so satisfactory to
<span class="corr" id="xd21e487" title=
"Source: Sturvius">Struvius</span> that he ceased to doubt in the
existence of such a book, because he knew the year in which Campannelle
was born (1568.) and knew also that the book was printed thirty years
before this, viz. in 1538. Afterwards in pushing their researches
farther, they resolved to consider <span class="corr" id="xd21e490"
title="Source: Baccaccio">Boccaccio</span> as the author of the work,
from a misinterpreted passage in Chap. 2, No. 6, in the &ldquo;Atheism
Overthrown&rdquo; where the following words occur; &ldquo;Hence
Boccaccio in his impious fables, contends that there is no distinction
between the law of Moses, of Christ and of Mahomet, because they are as
like each other as the three similar rings.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e493src" href="#xd21e493" name="xd21e493src">17</a>&rdquo; But
does Campannelle, in this passage intend to say that Boccaccio was the
author of &ldquo;The Three Impostors?&rdquo; So far is this from being
the case, that he answers elsewhere the objections of the Atheists
against Boccaccio and the book in question; and Struvius himself, in
the 9th paragraph of his dissertation on &ldquo;Learned
Impostors&rdquo; quotes a passage from Ernstius, which states that
Campannelle had told him that the book was written by Muret; now Muret
having been born in 1526, and the book been printed in 1538, he could
only have been 12 years of age; at which time of life we cannot suppose
it possible that he was able to write a work of this description. It
follows therefore that this book, said to have been written in Latin
and printed in Germany, never existed. At no period has there been a
printed work, however rarely to be met with, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22" name="pb22">22</a>]</span>in
reference to which very authentic and circumstantial information could
not be found.</p>
<p class="par">Although the works of Michael Servetus may never be met
with, it has always been well known that they were printed, and
moreover where they were printed. Before the publication of the two
modern editions of the &ldquo;Cymbalum Mundi,&rdquo; composed by
Bonnaventure de Perrieres, writing under the assumed name of Thomas du
Clevier, who says that he had translated it from the Latin, and of
which work only two ancient copies remain, the one in the King&rsquo;s
library and the other in that of M. Bigot at Rouen;&mdash;before the
publication of the the modern editions, it was an ascertained fact that
the work had been printed, and the date and name of the bookseller were
known. The case is exactly the same as regards &ldquo;The Blessings of
Christianity, or the Scourge of the Faith,&rdquo; the author of which,
Geoffrey Vallee a native of Orleans, was hanged and burned at Greve, on
the 9th February 1573, after having adjured his errors. It is a small
octavo work of thirty pages, without date, or the name of the place
where it was printed; a trifle, feebly reasoned, and now become so rare
that perhaps the copy belonging to Monsieur the Abbe d&rsquo;Estrees is
the only one to be found. But although all these works had absolutely
perished, no one could doubt their previous existence, the facts on
record concerning them being as true, as those concerning &lsquo;The
Three Impostors&rsquo; are apocryphal. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">An attempt at discussion, which you will find at
the end of the new edition of &ldquo;Menagiana,&rdquo; which has just
been published in this country, affords me the opportunity of giving
some information to the public on a subject which appears to call into
exercise the ingenuity of almost all the learned; and at the same time
of vindicating the character of many eminent men, and men of
distinguished merit, who have been attacked as the authors of the work
which forms the subject of a disquisition attributed to M. de la
Monnoye. Without doubt this new book is already in your possession; you
will perceive that I allude to &ldquo;The Three Impostors.&rdquo; The
author of the dissertation upholds the non-existence of such a book,
and attempts to establish his point by bringing forward conjectures,
without advancing any evidence capable in the smallest degree of
influencing the opinions of those who are accustomed to examine before
they decide. I will not undertake to refute <i>seriatim</i> the
articles contained in a dissertation, the substance of which is to be
found in a Latin discourse by M. <span class="corr" id="xd21e518"
title="Source: Burchard Gottheffle Struves">Burkhard Gotthelf
Struve</span>, on &ldquo;Learned Impostors,&rdquo; printed for the
second time at Geneva, by Muller in 1706, and which M. de la Monnoye
must have seen, because he quotes from it. He will acknowledge that I
am quite prepared to overturn his arguments, when I inform him that I
have read this celebrated little work, and that I have it in my
library. I will give you and the public an account of the way in which
I discovered it, and as it is in my possession, I will subjoin a short
but faithful description of it.</p>
<p class="par">Being at Frankfort on the Main in 1706, I called one day
in company with a Jew, and a friend named Frecht, at that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href="#pb24" name="pb24">24</a>]</span>time a
student in Theology, on an eminent bookseller in whose establishment
almost every work was to be met with. We were examining his catalogue
when there entered a German officer, who addressed himself to the
proprietor in German, and asked him if he was ready to agree to his
proposals, or if another merchant should be sought after. Frecht, who
formerly was acquainted with the officer, saluted him and was
recognised. This gave an <span class="corr" id="xd21e525" title=
"Source: oportunity">opportunity</span> to my friend of asking the
officer, whose name was Trawsendorff, what transaction he had with the
bookseller. Trawsendorff told him that he had two manuscripts and a
very old book in his possession, by the sale of which he expected to
raise a sum of money against the approaching campaign, and that the
bookseller higgled on 50 Rix-dollars, being unwilling to advance more
than 450 for the three works, which he, (the officer), valued at 500.
This great sum of money demanded for two manuscripts and a <span class=
"corr" id="xd21e528" title="Source: litttle">little</span> book excited
the curiosity of Frecht, who asked of his friend if he might see the
productions which he wished to sell at so dear a rate. Trawsendorff
immediately drew from his pocket a parchment envelope, tied with a silk
thread, which he opened, and from which he took the three books. We
went into the parlour of the bookseller to examine them at our leisure,
and the first which Frecht looked at had been printed, but had a title
written in Italian instead of its real title, which had been defaced.
It ran thus; &ldquo;<span lang="it">Spaccio della Bestia
triumphante</span>,&rdquo; and did not appear to be of an ancient date.
It struck me as being the same work which Toland translated into
English, and printed some years ago, and the copies of which sell very
high.</p>
<p class="par">The second we looked at was an old Latin manuscript
written in a character very difficult to decypher, without any title;
but at the top of the first page there were written these words,
&ldquo;Fredric the Emperor wishes health to Otho, his most illustrious
and dearest friend.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e536src" href="#xd21e536"
name="xd21e536src">1</a>&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The work opens with a letter, the first lines of which
are as follows; &ldquo;I will send you as soon as possible a copy of
the work on the three most celebrated deceivers of mankind,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25" name=
"pb25">25</a>]</span>a work written at my request by a very learned
man, and transcribed by my order for my library; and along with it
another work written in the same pure and polished style, for,
&amp;c.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e546src" href="#xd21e546"
name="xd21e546src">2</a> The third was also a Latin manuscript without
a title, commencing with a quotation from Cicero.</p>
<p class="par">Frecht having glanced over the books in a hurried way,
fixed his attention upon the second, of which he had often heard, and
in respect to which he had read many conflicting histories; and without
looking into the other two, he took Trawsendorff aside and told him
that he would easily find purchasers of the three works. He spoke
little of the Italian work, and by reading a few passages he showed him
that the other was a demonstration of Atheism. As the bookseller still
held to his terms, and would not come up to the officer&rsquo;s demand,
we went all three to the lodgings of Frecht, who having an object in
view called for wine, and while begging Trawsendorff to inform us how
he came by the works, he made him swallow so many bumpers that he soon
became half intoxicated, so that Frecht had little difficulty in
persuading him to leave with him the manuscript of &ldquo;The Three
most celebrated Deceivers of Mankind;&rdquo; but he made him take a
solemn oath that he would not copy it. On this condition, the work was
to be left with us from Wednesday till Sunday night, when Trawsendorff
was to call again and take his share of a few bottles of Frecht&rsquo;s
wine, which seemed to be much to his taste.</p>
<p class="par">As I had quite as much desire as Frecht to be acquainted
with the book, we sat down immediately to read it over, determining to
sleep very little until Sunday night. It was not very large&mdash;an
octavo work of ten sections, exclusive of the prefatory letter, but in
so small a character, and so full of contractions, besides being
without points, that we had much difficulty in decyphering the first
page in two hours. After this however we read it more easily, which
made me suggest to my friend a plan (rather Jesuitical) whereby he
might obtain a copy of this celebrated work without breaking
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href="#pb26" name=
"pb26">26</a>]</span>his oath which he had taken on
compulsion;&mdash;that it was likely that Trawsendorff, when he
insisted that it should not be copied, only meant that he should not
transcribe the words&mdash;in short that we were quite at liberty to
translate it. To which Frecht consented after some scruples, and we set
to work immediately. On Sunday we were in possession of the work a
little before midnight. Trawsendorff afterwards got his 500 rix-dollars
for the work from a bookseller who had been commissioned by a Prince of
the House of Saxe to purchase it. The Prince knew that it had been
stolen from the Royal Library at Munich, when the Germans obtained
possession of the city after the defeat of the French and Bavarians at
Hochstet, and Trawsendorff acknowledged to us that, being alone in the
library of the Elector, the parchment envelope with its yellow silk
thread attracted his attention, and that he could not resist the
temptation to steal it: expecting that it contained some rare
production, in which he was not disappointed.</p>
<p class="par">To complete the history of this treatise, I will give
you the conjectures which Frecht and I made as to its origin. We agreed
at once that the &ldquo;<i lang="la">Illustrissimo Otho</i>&rdquo; to
whom it was sent, was &ldquo;Otho the Illustrious,&rdquo; Duke of
Bavaria, son of Louis I. and grandson of &ldquo;Otho the Great,&rdquo;
Count of Schiven and Witelspach, to whom the Emperor Frederick
Barbarossa had given Bavaria as a reward for his fidelity, after he
took it away from &ldquo;Henry the Lion,&rdquo; as a punishment for his
ingratitude. &ldquo;Otho the Illustrious&rdquo; succeeded his father
Louis I<span class="corr" id="xd21e560" title="Not in source">.</span>,
in 1230, under the reign of Fredrick II<span class="corr" id="xd21e563"
title="Not in source">.</span>, grandson of Frederick Barbarossa, who
had at that time quarrelled with the Count of Rome on his return from
Jerusalem. This led us to think that the letters F. I. S. D. which
followed the &ldquo;<i lang="la">Amico meo carissimo</i>,&rdquo;
denoted Fredericus Imperator Salutem Dicit, and that the treatise was
<span class="corr" id="xd21e569" title="Source: wirtten">written</span>
posterior to the year 1230, by the order of this Emperor, inflamed as
he was against all Religions in consequence of the bad treatment he had
met with from the head of his own, viz. Pope Gregory IX. by whom he had
been <span class="corr" id="xd21e573" title=
"Source: excommnnicated">excommunicated</span> before he set out, and
who persecuted him even in Syria by intriguing to such an extent, that
the Emperor&rsquo;s army refused to obey his orders. This Prince on his
return besieged the Pope at Rome, after having <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href="#pb27" name="pb27">27</a>]</span>ravaged
the neighboring territory, and thereafter made a peace with him which
was of no long duration, and which was followed by an animosity so
bitter between him and the Holy Pontiff, that it only ceased at the
death of the latter, who died heart-broken that Frederick triumphed in
spite of his empty fulminations, and that he had unmasked the vices of
the Papal Chair in satirical verses which he circulated in every
quarter,&mdash;in Germany, Italy, and France. But we could not discover
who was the &ldquo;<i lang="la">doctissimus vir</i>,&rdquo; with whom
Otho appears to have held converse on the subject in the library, and
apparently in the company of the Emperor; unless indeed it were the
celebrated Pierre des Vignes, the secretary, or as others maintain, the
chancellor of Frederick II. His discourse &ldquo;On Sovereign
Power,&rdquo; and his &ldquo;Letters,&rdquo; give proof of his
learning, and the zeal which he had for the interests of his master,
and of his own hatred of Pope Gregory IX, and the Ecclesiastics and
established Churches of his day. It is true, that in one letter he
attempts to exculpate his master from the charges against him as the
author of this book: but this strengthens the supposition, and inclines
us to think he only pleaded for Frederick, to cloak his own share in so
scandalous a work. At all events we must believe that he would have
confessed the truth when Frederick, on suspicion that he had conspired
against his life, condemned him to lose his eyes, and handed him over
to the inhabitants of Pisa, his cruel enemies; and where despair
hurried on his death in an infamous dungeon where he could hold
intercourse with no one.</p>
<p class="par">In this way we can repel the false charges brought
against Averroes, Boccaccio, Dolet, Aretino, Servetus, Ochinus, Postel,
Pompanacius, Campannelle, Poggio, Pulci, Muret, Vanini, Milton, and
many others; the book having been written by a learned man in high
repute at the court of this Emperor, and by his order. As to the
<i>printing</i> of the book they can bring forward no <i>proof</i>
whatever; and it is impossible to conceive that Frederick, surrounded
as he was by enemies, would have circulated a work which gave fair
opportunity of proclaiming his infidelity. It is probable therefore
that there are only two copies, the original one and that sent to Otho
of Bavaria. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28" name=
"pb28">28</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">This will suffice as to the discovery of the book, and
its date; we come now to what it contains.</p>
<p class="par">It is divided into six books or chapters, every one of
which contains several <span class="corr" id="xd21e594" title=
"Source: pagaraphs">paragraphs</span>. The first Chapter has for its
title &ldquo;Of <span class="sc">God</span>,&rdquo; and contains six
paragraphs in which the author, wishing to appear free from party or
educational prejudices, shows that although mankind have a real
interest in ascertaining the truth, nevertheless they found upon
opinions and imaginations alone; and meeting with people whose interest
it is to keep them in this state, they are made to rest, contented in
it, although they could easily shake off the yoke by making the
<span class="corr" id="xd21e600" title=
"Source: slighest">slightest</span> use of their reason. He passes next
to the ideas which men entertain of the Divinity, and prove that they
are injurious, inasmuch as they have led to the creation of the most
fearful and imperfect being whom it is possible to conceive of; and he
then blames the ignorance of the people, or rather their foolish
credulity in putting faith in the visions of Prophets and Apostles, of
whom he draws a portrait suited to the ideas which he entertains of
them.</p>
<p class="par">The second Chapter treats of the reasons which have led
men to believe in a divinity. It is divided into eleven paragraphs,
where he proves that the ignorance of physical causes has given birth
to a fear natural enough at the sight of a thousand terrible accidents,
and has led them to believe in the existence of some invisible Power; a
doubt, and a fear, of which subtle politicians have taken advantage,
for their own interest, and which have given rise to a belief in this
Existence, which has been confirmed by others who have found it for
their own benefit to maintain it; although it is merely grounded on the
folly of the common people, always admirers of the extraordinary, the
sublime, and the marvellous. He next inquires into the nature of the
Divinity, and overturns the vulgar belief in final causes, as contrary
to sound philosophy. In fine, he makes it appear that such ideas of the
Divinity are only formed after having decided what is perfect, good,
evil, virtue, vice, according to imagination, and often as false as
possible. In his tenth paragraph the author explains his own opinion as
to the Divinity, which is conformable to the system of the Pantheists,
saying that the word God <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href=
"#pb29" name="pb29">29</a>]</span>represents an infinite Being, one of
whose attributes is that he is of unlimited extension, and consequently
that he is infinite and eternal. In the eleventh paragraph he treats
with ridicule the popular opinion which is given to the Deity, a
resemblance to the kings of the earth; and passing to the sacred books,
he speaks of them in a very unfavourable manner.</p>
<p class="par">The third Chapter has for its <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e610" title="Source: tittle">title</span> &ldquo;The signification
of the word Theology, and how, and for what purpose so many religions
have been introduced into the world.&rdquo;&mdash;This chapter contains
twenty-three paragraphs. In the ninth he examines the origin of
religions; and brings forward examples and reasonings which, so far
from being divine, are altogether the work of politicians. In the tenth
paragraph he undertakes to expose the imposture of Moses, showing what
he was, and how he managed to establish the Jewish religion. In the
eleventh paragraph he inquires into the impostures of several
politicians such as Numa, and Alexander the Great. In the twelfth he
examines the birth of Jesus Christ; in the thirteenth and following he
considers his morality, which he does not think more pure than that of
a great number of ancient philosophers; in the nineteenth he inquires
whether his reputation after his death is sufficient to warrant his
believing in his divinity. Lastly, in the twenty-second and
twenty-third paragraphs, he considers the imposture of Mahomet, of whom
he does not say so much, because he has not to encounter so many
advocates of his doctrine as that of the two others.</p>
<p class="par">The fourth Chapter treats of truth evident and obvious
to the senses, and consists only of <span class="corr" id="xd21e615"
title="Source: sixth">six</span> paragraphs, where he demonstrates what
really is the divinity, and what are his attributes: he rejects the
belief in a life to come, and the existence of spirits.</p>
<p class="par">The fifth Chapter treats &ldquo;Of the Soul.&rdquo; It
consists of seven paragraphs in which, after having exposed the vulgar
opinions, he gives those of the Philosophers of antiquity, and
concludes by showing the nature of the Soul according to his own
system.</p>
<p class="par">In the sixth and last Chapter of seven paragraphs, he
discourses on the Spirits called <i>Demons</i>, and shows the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30" name=
"pb30">30</a>]</span>origin and falsity of the opinions as to their
existence.&mdash;Such is the anatomy of this celebrated work. I might
have given it in a manner more extended and more minute; but besides
that this letter is already too long, I think that enough has been said
to give insight into the nature of its contents. A thousand other
reasons which you will well enough understand, have prevented me from
entering upon it to so great a length as I could have done; &ldquo;Est
modus in rebus.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e627src" href="#xd21e627"
name="xd21e627src">3</a>&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Now although this book were ready to be printed with the
preface in which I have given its history, and its discovery, with some
conjectures as to its origin, and a few remarks which may be placed at
its conclusion, yet I do not believe that it will live to see the day
when men will be compelled all at once to quit their opinions and their
imaginations, as they have quited their syllogisms, their canons, and
their other antiquated modes. As for me I will not expose myself to the
<i>Theological stylus</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e634src" href=
"#xd21e634" name="xd21e634src">4</a>, which I fear as much as Fra-Poulo
feared the Roman stylus, to afford to a few learned men the pleasure of
reading this little treatise; but neither will I be so superstitious,
on my death bed, as to make it be thrown into the flames, which we are
informed was done by Salvius, the Swedish ambassador at the peace of
Munster. Those who come after me may do what seems them good&mdash;they
cannot disturb me in the tomb. Before I descend to that, I remain with
much respect, your most obedient servant,</p>

<h2 class="main">COPY OF THE SECOND PART, VOL. I, ARTICLE IX. OF,
&ldquo;LITERARY MEMOIRS.&rdquo; PUBLISHED AT THE HAGUE BY HENRY DU
SAUZET, 1716.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">It is impossible in the present day to doubt the
existence of &ldquo;The Three <span class="corr" id="xd21e654" title=
"Source: Imposters">Impostors</span>,&rdquo; since we find several
manuscript copies of it. If M. de la <span class="corr" id="xd21e657"
title="Source: Monneye">Monnoye</span> had observed the agreement of it
with an extract published at Leyden, 1st. Jan. 1716,&mdash;the same
division into six chapters&mdash;the same titles, and the same subjects
of which they treat, he would have exclaimed against the forgery of
this work, improperly attributed to Pierre des Vignes, the Secretary
and Chancellor of Frederick II. This judicious critic long ago observed
the difference between the Gothic style of Pierre des <span class=
"corr" id="xd21e660" title="Source: Pignes">Vignes</span> in his
Epistles, and that of the letter pretended to be addressed to the Duke
of Bavaria, &ldquo;Otho the illustrious,&rdquo; when they sent him the
work. A more important point has not escaped the notice of the learned.
This treatise is written and argued in the method and upon the
principles of the New Philosophy, which was not introduced until about
the middle of the seventeenth century, after Descartes, Gassendi,
Bernier, and some others had explained its principles in a juster and
clearer way than did the ancient philosophers, who wished to preserve
their secrets, as they affected a mysterious obscurity in favor of the
initiated. The author himself, in the fifteen chapter of his work,
names Descartes, and combats the arguments of this great man on the
subject of the soul. Neither Pierre des Vignes, nor any of those whom
they have attempted to pass off as the author of this book, could have
reasoned according to the principles of the new Philosophy, which was
not introduced till after they had written. To whom then must the work
be attributed? We must conclude that it cannot be of the same date as
the short letter printed at Leyden, 1717. But another difficulty
occurs. Tentzelius, who wrote in 1689, also gives an extract from this
book upon the credit of a pretended ocular witness. But without
attempting to fix the date of this book, which is said to have been
composed in Latin and printed; the small French <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32" name=
"pb32">32</a>]</span>manuscript treatise, whether it had ever been
written in that language or whether it is translated from the Latin,
(which is difficult to believe,) cannot be of a very ancient date.</p>
<p class="par">This is not the only book composed under this title and
upon the same subject. A man whose character and profession ought to
have led him to engage in matters more decorous, composed a great work
(in French) under the same title. In his preface he says that it is
long since he had heard of &ldquo;The Three Impostors,&rdquo; but that
he had never found any part of it, whether there had never existed such
a work, or whether it be lost; therefore he attempts to restore it by
writing on the same subject. His work is very long, very wearisome, and
very badly written; with little principles and less argument. It is a
confused jumble of all the invectives and calumnies circulated against
the Three Legislators. The manuscript was in two volumes folio, thick,
and legible enough, although in small characters&mdash;the book is
divided into a great many chapters. Another similar manuscript was
found after the death of a nobleman. This gave rise to an attempt to
seize the author who having been informed of it took care that nothing
should be found among his papers to convict him. Afterwards he lived in
a monastery under penance. In 1733 he recovered his liberty and enjoyed
a revenue of 250 livres from the Abbey of St. Liquarie, in addition to
a reserved one of 350 livres from his benefice. His name was Guillaume,
Cure of Fresne-sur-Berny, and the brother of a labourer in the
Netherlands. He was at one time Regent of the College of Montaigu; in
his youth he had been a dragoon, and then <span class="corr" id=

<p class="par first">Although it is important that all men should know
the truth, there are nevertheless few who enjoy this advantage; some
are incapable of finding it out unassisted, and others will not put
themselves to the trouble. It is not to be wondered at therefore, if
the world is filled with vain and absurd opinions; and nothing is more
adapted to spread them than ignorance, which is the sole originator of
the false ideas which prevail as to the Divinity, the Soul, the
existence of Spirits, and almost all the other subjects which go to
make up Theology. Custom is powerful&mdash;men rest contented in the
prejudices of their birth, and leave the care of the most essential
matters to interested parties, who make it a rule to uphold with
bigotry the received opinions, and who dare not overturn them lest in
so doing they should destroy themselves.</p>

<p class="par first">What renders the evil without remedy is this,
that, after having established these false ideas of the Divinity, they
neglect no plan to compel the people to believe in them, without
permitting any one to examine for himself. On the contrary, they have
excited a hatred against philosophers&mdash;the truly learned, lest the
doctrines which they would teach should lead to the exposure of those
errors in which they have plunged mankind. The advocates of these
foolish notions have succeeded so well, that it is dangerous to combat
them. It is too much the interest of those impostors <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35" name="pb35">35</a>]</span>that the
people be ignorant, to permit them to become enlightened. Thus the
truth must either be kept in abeyance, or its promoters be prepared to
be sacrificed at the shrine of a false philosophy, and to suffer from
the rage of grovelling and interested minds.</p>

<p class="par first">If the people could understand into what an abyss
they are sunk by ignorance, <span class="corr" id="xd21e730" title=

unworthy leaders, for it is impossible not to discover the truth when
reason is left to its unrestrained exercise.</p>
<p class="par">These deceivers are so well aware of this, that to
prevent the good effects which Truth would infallibly produce, they
have painted it as a monster incapable of giving rise to any virtuous
sentiment; although, in general terms, they condemn <i>unreasonable</i>
people, they would nevertheless be much disconcerted if the truth were
heard. Thus these sworn enemies to common sense are perpetually falling
into contradictions, and it is difficult to discover at what they are
aiming. If it be true that reason is the only light which men ought to
follow, and if the people are not so incapable of judging as they wish
us to believe, it ought to be the object of those who instruct them to
endeavour to rectify the false reasonings, and to uproot their
prejudices; then their eyes would be gradually opened and their minds
convinced that the Deity is by no means what is generally supposed.</p>

<p class="par first">To attain this, there is no need for lofty
speculations, nor for penetrating far into the mysteries of nature. It
requires only a little common sense to perceive that the Deity is
neither choleric nor jealous; that justice and mercy are alike falsely
considered as his attributes; and that, all that the Prophets and
Apostles have said give us no information either as to his nature, or
to his essence.</p>
<p class="par">In short to speak plainly and to put the matter on its
proper footing, it will be allowed that these teachers were neither
more able nor better instructed than the rest of mankind; so far from
that being the case, what they advance regarding <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href="#pb36" name="pb36">36</a>]</span>the
Deity is so gross that the people must be altogether ignorant to credit
it. Although this is apparent enough we will attempt to explain it more
at length, by inquiring, if there is any evidence that the Prophets and
Apostles were differently constituted from other men.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">It is agreed, that as far as descent, and the
common duties of life are implicated, they possessed no quality to mark
them out from the rest of mankind. They were begotten by men, they were
born of women, and they sustained themselves as we do in the present
day. In reference to their minds, people would have us believe that God
dealt with these prophets in a way differing from that wherein he deals
with ordinary mortals, and that he disclosed himself to them in a
manner quite exclusive. Many persons consider this matter as a proved
and ascertained fact, without reflecting that every man may meet his
counterpart, and that we have one common origin; endeavouring at the
same time to persuade us that these men were cast in no common mould
and that they were selected by the Deity to proclaim his oracles. Now,
apart from the consideration that these inspired people were gifted
with only an average intellect, and with an understanding not much
above the common, what do we find in their writings to justify us in
forming so exalted an opinion of them? The matter of which they treat
is for the most part so obscure that no one can comprehend it, and
thrown together with so little order that it is easy to perceive they
did not understand it themselves; the whole showing that they were both
knaves and fools. Their impudence in boasting that whatever they
announced to the people came immediately from God, gave rise to the
respect which was paid to them. This assertion on their part was
equally absurd and ridiculous, seeing that according to their own
declaration God only spoke to them in dreams. There is nothing more
natural than that a man should dream; but a man must be very impudent,
very vain, and very stupid, to say that God speaks to him in this
manner, and a poor and credulous fool must he be who should yield
credence to such an assertion, and receive the dreams of such
visionaries <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37" name=
"pb37">37</a>]</span>for heavenly oracles. Suppose for a moment that
the Deity were to hold intercourse with a man by dreams, or visions, or
in any other way we can think of; nobody is obliged to believe this on
the mere assertion of a fellow-creature equally subject to error with
himself, and moreover, fallible in the way of lying and imposture.
Accordingly we find that under the ancient law, the prophets were held
in far less repute than they are at the present day. When people got
wearied of their babble, which often only tended to spread revolt and
to turn aside subjects from obedience to their sovereigns, they
silenced them by punishment. Jesus Christ himself did not escape
chastisement, for he had not, like Moses<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e754src" href="#xd21e754" name="xd21e754src">1</a>, an army at his
back to defend his opinions. Add to this, that the prophets were so
much accustomed to contradict each other, that out of four hundred of
them not one true or truth-speaking man could be found.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e757src" href="#xd21e757" name="xd21e757src">2</a>
Moreover it is certain that the drift of their prophesies, like that of
the laws promulgated by the most celebrated legislators, was to
immortalize their memory by persuading people that they had conferences
with the Divinity. The most subtle politicians have invariably played
the same game, although this <i>ruse</i> has not succeeded with every
one as it did with Moses.</p>

<p class="par first">This being settled, let us examine for a little
the idea which the Prophets have formed of the Deity. According to
their account, God is a being purely corporeal. Michael saw him seated;
Daniel beheld him clothed in white, and under the form of an Old Man;
Ezekiel perceived him as a Fire: so much for the Old Testament. With
respect to the New, the disciples of Jesus Christ imagined that they
saw him in the form of a Dove; the Apostles, like Tongues of Fire; and
finally, St. Paul beheld him as a <span class="sc">Light</span>, which
dazzled and blinded him. Then as to their contradictory <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38" name=
"pb38">38</a>]</span>statements; in the Book of Genesis<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e776src" href="#xd21e776" name="xd21e776src">3</a> we
are informed that man is the master of his own actions, and that it
only depends upon himself to do what is right. St. Paul on the other
hand asserts that man has no control over his evil propensities without
the particular grace of God. Samuel<a class="noteref" id="xd21e780src"
href="#xd21e780" name="xd21e780src">4</a> declares that the Deity
repented of the <i>evil</i> which he had brought on men: and
Jeremiah<a class="noteref" id="xd21e790src" href="#xd21e790" name=
"xd21e790src">5</a> affirms that he repented, or on certain conditions
that he would repent, of the <i>good</i> which he had done them. Such
are the false and contradictory ideas which those pretenders to
inspiration give us of the divinity; and which they wish us to adopt
without reflecting that they represent the Deity as a sensitive Being,
material, and subject to like passions with ourselves. Next they inform
us that God has nothing in common with matter, and that his nature is
altogether incomprehensible by us. It would be important to learn how
these manifest and irrational contradictions can be reconciled; and
whether we ought to put much faith in the evidence of a people who, in
spite of the sermons of Moses, were stupid enough to believe that a
calf was their God! Without dwelling on the reveries of a people
cradled in bondage and brought up in absurdity, it is sufficient to
remark, that ignorance has produced a belief in all the impostures and
errors which prevail amongst us at the present day.</p>

the ear for hearing; a sun above them to give them light and heat; they
concluded that there was nothing in nature which was not made for them
and which they could not enjoy and dispose of; but as they well knew
that <i>they</i> were not the creators of these things, they thought
that they were justified in imagining a Supreme Being, the author of
all; in one word they conceived that everything in existence was the
work of one, or of more Divinities. On the other hand, the nature of
the Gods whom men acknowledged being unknown to them, they believed
that they were susceptible of like passions with themselves; and as the
natural dispositions of men are different, every one rendered to his
Divinity a worship according to his fancy, with the view of drawing
down his blessings, and making universal nature subservient to his own

<p class="par first">In this manner prejudice was changed into
superstition. It was rooted in such a way that the most ignorant people
believed themselves capable of explaining the doctrine of <i>final
causes</i>, as if they had an entire knowledge of them.&mdash;Thus,
instead of proving that Nature did nothing in vain, they imagined that
God and Nature thought after the manner of men. Experience taught them
that an infinite number of calamities disturbed the pleasures of
life&mdash;storms, earthquakes, plagues, hunger, thirst, &amp;c. They
attributed all these evils to divine wrath, and believed that the Deity
was irritated against mankind for their offences; nor could the daily
occurring examples which prove that good and evil happen alike to the
just and unjust, disabuse them of their prejudices. This error
prevailed, because they found it easier to remain in their natural
ignorance, than to divest themselves of notions established for so many

<p class="par first">There is no necessity for a long dissertation to
prove that nature never aims at any definite end, and that all these
<i>final causes</i> are only human fictions. It is sufficient to show
that this doctrine deprives the Deity of all the perfections which have
been attributed to him; and this we will endeavor to do.</p>
<p class="par">If God acts for an end, either for himself or for any
other being, he desires that which he does not possess; and it must be
granted from these premises that, as there was a time when God had no
object for which to act, he wished to have one; that is to say, <i>that
he stood in need of something</i>. But not to overlook anything which
may strengthen the arguments of those who maintain the opposite
opinion, suppose, for a moment, that a stone detached from a battlement
fell upon an individual and killed him; it proves, say our opponents,
that this stone fell for the purpose of killing this person, because it
could not so have happened unless God had wished it. If we reply that
it was the wind which caused its fall at the time when the unfortunate
individual was passing, they demand at once, how it happened that he
was passing exactly at the time when the wind brought down the stone.
We answer, that he was on his way to dine with a friend who had invited
him; they wish to know why his friend had invited him on that day
rather than on any other. They put in this manner an infinitude of
absurd questions to force you to confess that the will of God alone
(which is the refuge of the ignorant) was the real cause of the fall of
this stone. When they examine the structure of the human body, they
fall into ecstacies; but because they are ignorant of the causes of
those effects <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42" name=
"pb42">42</a>]</span>which appear to them so marvellous, they conclude
that it must be a supernatural effect, when the causes which are known
to us account for it. This is the reason why the man who wishes deeply
to examine the works of creation, and like a true philosopher to
penetrate into their natural causes, irrespective of those prejudices
which ignorance has created, is branded as an infidel, or speedily
clamoured down by the malice of those whom the vulgar acknowledge as
the interpreters of Nature and of the Gods. These mercenary spirits are
well aware that the ignorance which holds the people in wonderment, is
that which gives them bread, and upholds their credit.</p>

<p class="par first">Men being thus imbued with the ridiculous opinion
that every thing which they behold is created for themselves, have made
it a point of religion to engross every thing, and to judge of its
value by the profit which it brings. Accordingly they have invented
notions which do them service in explaining the nature of things, and
enable them to judge of good and evil, order and disorder, heat and
cold, beauty and ugliness, &amp;c. which are by no means what they
imagine. Because they are able to frame their ideas in this way, they
think that they are in a position to judge of praise and blame; of good
and evil. They call that <i>good</i> which respects their divine
worship, and turns to their own profit; and that which does neither the
one nor the other they denominate <i>evil</i>; and because the ignorant
are incapable of judging, and have no conception of any thing save
through the medium of their imagination, which they mistake for
judgment, they tell us that nothing can be learned from nature, and
forthwith invent a particular arrangement of the world. In short they
think that matters are ill or well constituted according to the
facility or the difficulty which they have in conceiving of them when
presented to them through the medium of their senses. People are best
pleased with what gives least fatigue to the brain. These individuals
have wisely resolved to prefer order to confusion, as if order were any
thing else than a pure fiction of the imagination<span class="corr" id=

<p class="par first">With respect to their other opinions, they are
purely the result of this same imagination, having no basis in reality,
and being only different modifications of which that faculty is
susceptible. Thus, when the impressions made upon the nervous system
through the medium of the eyes are agreeable, they pronounce that the
objects viewed are beautiful. <i>Smells</i> are good or bad;
<i>tastes</i> are sweet or bitter, things <i>touched</i> are hard or
soft, according as the sensation produced is unpleasant or
otherwise&mdash;as scents, and tastes, and contact, and sounds affect
the system. Following up these ideas, men have believed that the Deity
is pleased with melody, while others have believed that all the
movements of the celestial bodies were one harmonious concert; a proof,
that these men are persuaded that things are really such as they
conceive them to be, or that the world is entirely ideal.&mdash;It is
not to be wondered at therefore, if we scarcely ever meet with two
individuals of the same opinion: indeed some make it their boast to
doubt of every thing; for, although all men have a similar bodily
conformation, and resemble each other in many respects, there are still
as many respects in which they differ. Accordingly it must follow, that
what pleases this party displeases that; and what appears good to one
man appears evil to another.&mdash;We must conclude therefore, that
their various opinions must be attributed to their different
organizations and the diversity of their co-existences&mdash;that
reason has little <span class="corr" id="xd21e919" title=

<p class="par first">It is therefore evident, that all the reasonings
which the generality of mankind are accustomed to employ when they set

imagining that which is most uncalculated <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

other quarter than in their own prejudiced brain; but instead of
calling them mere chimeras, they designate them Beings. There is
extremely little difficulty in refuting the arguments grounded on such
opinions.</p>
<p class="par">If it is true, as they advance, that the universe is
nothing more than an emanation from, or simply a necessary consequence
to, the Divine nature, whence spring those imperfections and defaults
which we perceive in it? This objection is easily answered. It is
impossible for men to judge of the perfection or imperfection of any
Being, without a thorough knowledge of his nature and essence<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e931src" href="#xd21e931" name="xd21e931src">2</a>,
and it is a strange abuse of terms to assert that any thing is more or
less perfect according as it pleases or displeases, or as it is useful
or noxious to human nature. To terminate the argument with those who
demand why God has not created all men good and happy, it is sufficient
to state that every thing is necessarily what it is; and that, in
nature there is no imperfection, since all flows from the necessity of
things.</p>

there are few contented with this simplicity. A gross people accustomed
to the gratification of their senses, have conceived that God resembles
the kings of the earth. That pomp and splendor which surround the
latter have dazzled them so much, that to uproot the idea that God has
no resemblance whatever to earthly sovereigns, would be to deprive them
of the hope of meeting celestial courtiers, and of enjoying in their
company, the same pleasures which they had tasted at regal courts; it
would take from them the only consolation which keeps them from despair
amidst the miseries of this life. They assert that God must be a just
and avenging Being who punishes and recompenses&mdash;they represent
him as susceptible of every human passion&mdash;they depict him with
feet, with hands, with eyes and with ears, and yet maintain that he is
an immaterial Being. They quote Scripture to prove that man is chief of
God&rsquo;s works below, and formed in his own image; and deny that the
copy has the slightest resemblance to the original. In short, the God
of the people in the present day, as represented by themselves, is
subject to more transformations than the Pagan Jupiter. What is still

have enounced, although these visionaries only held the same place
among the Hebrews, as did the augurs and soothsayers amongst the
pagans. They consult the Bible as if God and Nature had explained it to
them exclusively, although it is only a tissue of fragments gathered
together at various periods, and by different persons, and published
under the censorship of the Rabbis.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e967src"

their lives in quibbles, and persist in reverencing a book which has
scarcely more arrangement than the Alcoran of Mahomet&mdash;a book
which from its obscurity nobody understands, and which has only served
to foment divisions. The Jew and Christians love far better to consult
this legerdemain book, than to listen to that which God, that is to say
Nature (inasmuch as it is the origin of all things) has written on
their hearts. All other laws are merely human figments&mdash;palpable
illusions set abroad, not by demons or evil spirits, which are the
creations of the fancy, but by the policy of princes, and the craft of
priests. The former have striven in this way to add weight to their
authority; and the latter have been contented to enrich themselves by
the sale of an infinitude of chimerical notions, which they vend at a
dear rate to their ignorant followers.</p>
<p class="par">No other code of laws which has followed that of Moses,
except the Christian, has been based upon that Bible the original of
which could never be discovered, which relates to things supernatural
and impossible, and which speaks of rewards and punishments for actions
good or bad, but wisely <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href=

lest the imposture should be detected; for no one has ever returned
from the grave. Thus the people, kept always fluctuating between hope
and fear, are held in bondage by the belief that God has created
mankind for no other purpose than that of rendering them eternally
happy or everlastingly miserable. This is the origin of the vast number
of religions which prevail in the world.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Before the term <i>Religion</i> was introduced
into the world, mankind followed the law of Nature, that is, they lived
conformably to Reason. Instinct was the only bond by which men were
united; and this bond, simple as it is, was so strong that divisions
were rare. But after terror led them to suspect that there were Gods
and invisible Powers, they built altars to the imaginary beings, and
shaking off the yoke of reason and of Nature, they bended themselves by
foolish ceremonies, and by a superstitious worship of the idle phantoms
which themselves had imagined.</p>
<p class="par">Such was the origin of the word <i>Religion</i>, which
has made so much noise in the world. After having admitted the
existence of these invisible Agencies, men worshipped them to
depreciate their anger, and moreover they believed that nature was
under the control of these Powers. Afterwards they came to regard
themselves as inert matter, or as slaves who could only act under the
commands of these imaginary beings. This false idea having obtained
possession of their minds, they began to exhibit more contempt for
nature, and more respect for those whom they called their Gods. Hence
sprung that ignorance in which so many nations were immersed&mdash;an
ignorance from which, however profound, the true philosophers might
have freed them, if <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48"
name="pb48">48</a>]</span>they had not been always thwarted by those
who led the blind, and throve by their own impostures.</p>
<p class="par">Now, although there were little appearance of success in
our undertaking, we must not forsake the cause of truth. A generous
mind will speak of things as they really are, out of regard to those
who exhibit symptoms of this malady. The truth, whatever its nature may
be, can never be injurious; whereas error, although at the time
apparently innocent and even useful, must finally terminate in the most
disastrous results.</p>

<p class="par first">Terror having thus created the Gods, men wished to
ascertain their nature, and conceiving that they must be of the same
substance as the Soul, which they thought was like the appearances in a
mirror, or the phantoms of sleep, they believed that their Gods were
real substances, but so thin and subtle that to distinguish them from
<i>Bodies</i> they named them <i>Spirits</i>; although <i>Bodies</i>
and <i>Spirits</i> are in truth one and the same thing, for it is
impossible to imagine an <i>incorporeal Spirit</i>. Every spirit has
its proper shape, which is inclosed in some body; that is, it has its
limits, and consequently it is a body, however subtle its
nature.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1022src" href="#xd21e1022" name=

<p class="par first">The ignorant, that is the majority of mankind,
having thus determined the nature and substance of their Gods,
endeavoured next to discover the means by which these invisible agents
acted; and unable to arrive at this because of their ignorance, they
had recourse to their own conjectures, judging blindly of the future
from the past. How is it possible to draw rational conclusions from any
thing which has formerly happened in a certain way, as to what will
happen hereafter, seeing that all the circumstances and all the causes
which necessarily influence events and human actions, are so
exceedingly different. They persisted however in contemplating the
past, and they augured well or ill as to the future, according as any
former similar undertaking had been successful or otherwise. On this
principle, because <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49"

battle of Naupactus, the Athenians, after his death appointed another
commander of the same name. Hannibal having been conquered by Scipio
Africanus, the Romans, on account of his success, sent to the same
province, Scipio C&aelig;sar, who was unsuccessful both against the
Greeks<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1032src" href="#xd21e1032" name=

after two or three experiments, only attributed their bad or good
fortune to places, to objects, and to names. Others employed certain
words which they denominated <i>spells</i>, which they considered
efficacious enough to make trees speak, to create a man or a God from a
morsel of bread, and in short to metamorphose whatever appeared before
their eyes.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1043src" href="#xd21e1043" name=

images in which they feigned that the Divinities resided. This rained
gold into the coffers of the priesthood, and their benefices were
considered as sacred things because they belonged to holy ministers; no
one having the rashness or audacity to aspire to them. The better to
deceive mankind, the priests pretended to be divinely inspired
Prophets, capable of penetrating the mysteries of futurity, boasting
that they had intercourse with the Gods; and, as the desire is natural
to learn one&rsquo;s destiny, they by no means failed to take advantage
of it. Some were established at Delos, others at Delphi, and in various
places, where in ambiguous language they answered the questions put to
them. Even women took a part in these impostures, and the Romans in
their greatest difficulties consulted the Sybilline books. These knaves
were really considered inspired. Those who feigned that they had
familiar commerce with the dead were called Necromancers; others
pretended to ascertain the future from the flight of birds or the
entrails of beasts; in short they could draw a good or bad augury from
almost every thing, the eyes, the hands, the countenance, or any

<p class="par first">The celebrated Moses, a grandson of a
distinguished Magician,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1131src" href=
"#xd21e1131" name="xd21e1131src">5</a> (according to Justin Martyr)
possessed every advantage calculated to render him that which he
finally became. It is well known that the Hebrews, of whom he became
the chief, were a nation of shepherds whom Pharaoh Osiris I. admitted
into his kingdom in gratitude for the services which one of them had
rendered during a period of severe famine. He assigned them a territory
in the East of Egypt, rich in pasturage, and admirably adapted for the
rearing of cattle; where, during two centuries, they very much
increased in numbers, either, that being regarded as strangers they
were not liable to military service, or on account of the other
privileges which Osiris had conferred upon them. Many natives of the
country joined <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name=
"pb53">53</a>]</span>themselves to them, among others, bands of Arabs
who regarded them as brethren and of the same origin. However this may
be, they multiplied so exceedingly, that the land of Goshen being
unable to contain them, they spread over all the land of Egypt; giving
just occasion to Pharaoh to dread that they would undertake some
dangerous enterprise if his kingdom were attacked by the Ethiopians,
his inveterate enemies, as had frequently happened. Reasons of state,
therefore, compelled this monarch to take away their privileges, and to
devise some means of weakening them and keeping them in subjection.</p>
<p class="par">Pharaoh Orus, surnamed Busirus on account of his
cruelty, succeeded Memnon, and followed up his plans with respect to
the Hebrews; and wishing to eternalize his memory by building the
Pyramids, and fortifying the walls of Thebes, condemned the Hebrews to
the task of making bricks, for which purpose the earth of that country
was well adapted. During their bondage the celebrated Moses was born,
the same year in which the king commanded that all the male Hebrew
children should be thrown into the Nile, as the surest method of
ridding his country from this host of strangers. Moses was in this way
exposed to perish in the waters, his mother having placed him in a
wicker basket among the willows on the banks of the stream. It happened
that Thesmutis, the daughter of the king, was walking by the river,
when, hearing the cries of the infant, that compassion so natural to
her sex, inspired her with a wish to save it. Orus being dead she
succeeded him, and Moses having been presented to her she commanded
that he should receive the highest instruction which could be procured,
as a son of the Queen of a people at that time the most learned and
civilized in the world. &ldquo;He was learned in all the learning of
the Egyptians.&rdquo; This implies that he was the ablest Politician,
the greatest philosopher, and the most distinguished Magician of his
time; and besides, it is very evident that he had been initiated into
the Egyptian Priesthood, which resembled those of the Druids among the
Gauls. Those who are ignorant of the nature of the Egyptian government,
must learn that the whole territory was subject to one sole sovereign,
but that it was divided into many provinces of but limited extent. The
governors of these <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href="#pb54"
name="pb54">54</a>]</span>provinces were designated Monarchs, and were
generally of the powerful order of the Priesthood, which in fact
possessed almost the third part of Egypt. The king nominated these
Monarchs; and if we compare what others have written concerning Moses,
and what he has written himself, we must conclude that he was Monarch
of the Province of Goshen, and that he owed his appointment to
Thesmutis, to whom also he owed his life. Such was the <i>status</i> of
Moses amongst the Egyptians, where he had full time and every
opportunity of studying their manners and those of his own nation, and
of obtaining a knowledge of <span class="corr" id="xd21e1143" title=
"Source: thier">their</span> dominant inclinations and passions; a
knowledge, of which he failed not to avail himself in that revolution
of which he was the originator.</p>
<p class="par">After the death of Thesmutis, her successor renewed the
persecution against the Hebrews, and Moses having fallen from the honor
in which he had been formerly held, was afraid that he would find it
difficult to justify a homicide of which he had been guilty. He
accordingly resolved on flight, and retired into Arabia Petrea. Chance
led him to the house of the chief of some native tribe, to whom he
rendered so many services, and by whom his talents were so highly
appreciated that he gave him one of his daughters in marriage. It must
here be remarked that Moses was so little of a Jew, and had so limited
a conception of the Deity whom he afterwards imagined, that he married
an idolatress, and did not even think of circumcising his children.</p>
<p class="par">It was in the Arabian deserts, when watching the flocks
of his father-in-law, that he formed the design of taking vengeance
upon the King of Egypt for the injuries he had met with. He flattered
himself that he would easily succeed in this, as well on account of his
own talents, as from the feeling which he knew was general amongst
those of his own nation, irritated against the government on account of
the cruel treatment which they had experienced.</p>
<p class="par">It appears from the history which he has left us of this
revolution, or at all events, from the history which the author of the
books attributed to Moses, has left us, that Jethro, his father-in-law,
was in the plot, as were Aaron his brother, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55" name="pb55">55</a>]</span>and
sister Marion, who remained in Egypt, and with whom, no doubt, he
maintained a correspondence.</p>
<p class="par">However that may be, we perceive from the result, that
he had with the utmost policy schemed out a great design; and that he
knew how to bring to bear against the Egyptians that learning which he
had acquired amongst them. I allude to magic, in the exhibition of
which he showed himself more subtle and expert than all those who
attempted the same tricks at the court of Pharaoh.</p>
<p class="par">It was by these pretended prodigies that he gained over
those of his nation whom he wished to carry off, and to whom
disaffected and revolutionary Egyptians, Ethiopians and Arabs joined
themselves. By boasting the power of his Divinity, and the frequent
communions which he had with him; and by declaring that he had his
sanction for all the steps which he took with the leaders of the
revolution, he succeeded so well that there followed him 600,000
fighting men, besides women and children, across the Arabian deserts,
of which he well knew the localities. After six days painful flight, he
ordained to his followers that they should consecrate the seventh day
to his God by a general and public rest, for the purpose of persuading
them that the Deity favored him and approved of his authority; and to
deter any one from having the audacity to dispute his statements.</p>
<p class="par">There never existed a more ignorant people than the
Hebrews, nor consequently more credulous. To be assured of this we have
only to look to their condition in Egypt when Moses caused them to
revolt. They were detested by the Egyptians on account of their
profession as shepherds, they were persecuted by the sovereign, and
employed in the most degrading toil. Amongst a people thus situated it
could not be very difficult for a man with the abilities of Moses to
exercise a vast influence. He persuaded them that his God, (whom he
sometimes merely styles an angel), the God of their fathers, had
appeared to him&mdash;that it was at his command that he had taken them
under his guidance&mdash;and that they would be a people highly favored
of the Deity, provided they believed in him. The expert employment of
deceit, and his knowledge of science, and of human nature, fortified
his injunctions; and he strengthened his <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb56" href="#pb56" name="pb56">56</a>]</span>position by
<i>prodigies</i>, which are always sure to make a deep impression on
the minds of an imbecile populace.</p>
<p class="par">It must here be attended to with especial care, that he
thought he had discovered a sure method of keeping the Hebrews in
subjection to himself, by persuading them that God himself was their
conductor&mdash;that he preceded them by night as a pillar of fire, and
by day as a cloud. It can be proved that this is perhaps a more gross
deceit on the part of this leader than any he had ever practised.
During his sojourn in Arabia, he had learned that, as the country was
of vast extent and uninhabited, it was the custom of those who
travelled in caravans to take guides, who conducted them under night by
means of a brasier filled with burning wood, the flame of which they
followed; and the smoke of which by day equally prevented the parties
of the caravan from straggling. Moses took advantage of this and
proclaimed it miraculous, adducing it as an evidence of divine
protection. No person is called upon to regard this as cheat, on my
authority; let them believe Moses himself, who in the book of Numbers,
chap, x, v. 31, is represented as beseeching his brother-in-law Habab
to journey with the Israelites and show them the way, because he knew
the <i>country</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1170src" href=
"#xd21e1170" name="xd21e1170src">6</a> This is proof positive. If it
were really God who went before the people of Israel by night and by
day, as a pillar of cloud and of fire, could they have desired a better
guide? Notwithstanding here is this leader entreating his
brother-in-law in the most urgent manner to act as his guide; the
pillar of cloud and fire, it would seem, being only a God for the
people and not for Moses.</p>
<p class="par">The unfortunate dupes being delighted to find themselves
adopted by the chief of the Gods on their escape from a cruel bondage,
cheerfully put faith in Moses, and swore to obey him blindly. His
authority being confirmed, he wished to render it perpetual; and under
the <span class="corr" id="xd21e1185" title=
"Source: spacious">specious</span> pretext of establishing the worship
of that God whose <span class="corr" id="xd21e1188" title=
"Source: Vicegerent">Viceregent</span> he said he was, he appointed at
once his brother <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href="#pb57" name=
"pb57">57</a>]</span>and his sons to high authority in the Royal
Palace, that is the place whence he thought proper to give forth his
oracles; this place being altogether out of the view of the people.
Lastly he practised that which is always done at the formation of new
institutions; that is, he exhibited prodigies, miracles, whereby some
were dazzled, and others confounded, but which only excited pity in
those who could see through his impostures.</p>
<p class="par">However crafty Moses might have been, he would have had
considerable difficulty in securing obedience, without the aid of his
armed followers. An impostor without physical force rarely
succeeds.</p>
<p class="par">But in spite of the great number of dupes who submitted
themselves blindly to the will of this clever legislator, there were
found people bold enough to reproach him for bad faith; declaring that,
under false appearances of justice and equality, he had engrossed the
whole&mdash;that the sovereign authority was confined to his own
family, who had no more right to it than any other
individuals&mdash;and that he was less the father than the tyrant of
his people. But on these occasions Moses, with profound policy, put to
death those daring spirits and spared no one who disputed his
authority.</p>
<p class="par">It was by similar precautions, and by always declaring
that his punishments were instances of divine vengeance, that he
reigned an absolute despot; and to end as he had begun&mdash;that is to
say, as a knave and an impostor&mdash;he was in the habit of retiring
to a cave, which he had caused to be dug in the centre of a waste,
under the pretext of having conferences with the Divinity, that he

His end was like that of other similar impostors. He cast himself from
a precipice which he knew of in the remote wilderness, to the end that
his body might not be discovered, and that it might be thought the
Deity had carried him off. He was not ignorant that the memory of the
patriarchs which had preceded him was held in great veneration,
although they knew their sepulchres; but this was not enough for an
ambition like his&mdash;it was necessary that he should be revered as a
god, over whom death had no control. This is the explanation of what he
said at the commencement of his reign, when he said that God had
declared that he was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href="#pb58"

on a virgin nativity, regarding Apollo as his father. There have been

<p class="par first">Jesus Christ, who was acquainted with the maxims
and the science of the Egyptians, gave currency to the belief alluded
to above, because he thought it suitable to his purposes. Reflecting
how Moses had become renowned by his command of an ignorant people, he
undertook to build on this foundation, and got some few imbecile people
to follow him, whom he persuaded that the Holy Ghost was his father,
and that his mother was a virgin. These simple folks, accustomed to
give themselves over to dreams and reveries, adopted his opinions, and
believed whatever he wished: indeed, something considerably beyond this
miraculous birth would by no means have been too miraculous for them. A
beautiful dove overshadowed a virgin: there is nothing surprising in
that. It happened frequently in Lydia; and the swan of Leda is the
counterpart of the dove of Mary.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1249src"
href="#xd21e1249" name="xd21e1249src">11</a> That a man should be born
of a virgin, by the operation of the Holy Spirit, is neither more
extraordinary nor more miraculous that that Genghis Khan should be born
of a virgin, as the Tartars assert; or that Foh, according to the
Chinese belief, derived his origin from a virgin rendered pregnant by
the rays of the sun.</p>
<p class="par">This prodigy appeared at a time when the Jews, wearied

time startled at his boldness&mdash;forwarded or thwarted his
interests, according to the inconstant humour of the populace. The
report of his divine origin was spread about; but without forces, as he
was, it was impossible that he could succeed, although some cures which
he performed, and some resurrections from the dead to which he
pretended, brought him somewhat into repute. Without money or arms he
could not fail to perish: if he had been in possession of these, he
would have been no less successful than Moses or Mahomet, and all those
who, with like advantages, have elevated themselves above their
fellow-men. If he had been more unfortunate, he would not have been
less adroit; and several traits in his history prove that the principal
defect in his policy was his carelessness in not sufficiently providing
for his own security. Otherwise, I do not find that his plans were less
skilfully devised than those of the other two: at all events his law
has become the rule of faith to people who flatter themselves that they
are the wisest in the world.</p>

superscription upon it, and asked if it were lawful to pay tribute

&ldquo;Render unto C&aelig;sar the things which are

that it was lawful, he was guilty of high treason; and if he said that
it was, he went directly against the law of Moses, which he always
protested that he never intended to do&mdash;knowing no doubt that he
was too helpless to do so with impunity at that time. Afterwards, when
he became more celebrated, he endeavoured to abrogate it almost
totally: acting in this way not unlike those princes, who, until their
power is thoroughly established, always promise to confirm the
privileges of their subjects, but who, after that has been secured,
care little for their promises.</p>
<p class="par">When the Pharisees asked him by what authority he taught
the people and preached to them, he penetrated their
intention&mdash;which was to convict him of falsehood; whether he
answered that it was by human authority&mdash;he not being of the order
of the priesthood, who alone were charged with the instruction of the
people; or whether he preached by the express orders of God&mdash;his
own doctrine being opposed to the law of Moses; he avoided their snare,
and embarrassed themselves, by asking them in what name John
baptised.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1302src" href="#xd21e1302" name=

<p class="par">The Pharisees, who from political motives, rejected the
baptism of John, would have condemned themselves if they had said that
it was in the name of God; and if they had <i>not</i> said so, they
would have exposed themselves to the rage of the populace, who
maintained the opposite opinion. To get out of this dilemma, they
answered that they could not tell: on which Jesus Christ replied, that
neither was he obliged to tell them by what name or authority he taught
the people.</p>

<p class="par first">Such was the character of the destroyer of the
ancient law, and the founder of the new religion that was built upon
its ruins; in which religion a disinterested mind can perceive nothing
more divine than in any of those which preceded it. Its founder, who
was not altogether ignorant, having witnessed extreme corruption in the
Jewish republic, judged that its end was near, and thought it a
favorable opportunity for forwarding his own designs. <span class=

<p class="par">The fear of being anticipated by men more able than
himself, made him hasten to secure his ground by means entirely
opposite to those adopted by Moses. The former began by rendering
himself terrible to other nations. Jesus Christ, on the contrary,
attracted mankind to himself by the hope of blessings in a life beyond
the grave, which he said they would obtain by believing in him. Whilst
Moses only promised temporal benefits to the observers of his law,
Jesus Christ led his followers to hope for those which would never end.
The laws of the one only regarded exterior observances; those of the
other looked into the heart, influenced the thoughts, and stood on
opposite grounds to the law of Moses. Whence it follows, that Jesus
Christ believed with Aristotle, that it is the same with religion and
nations as with individuals who are born and who die; and as there is
nothing which is not subject to dissolution, there is no law which must
not in turn give place to another.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1320src"

in passing from one law to another, and as the greater part of men are

confounded the ignorant, and advanced the projects of ambitious and
designing men.</p>

<p class="par first">Christianity having been founded in this way,
Jesus Christ wisely imagined that he could profit by the errors in the
politics of Moses, and render his new law eternal&mdash;an undertaking
in which he finally succeeded a little perhaps beyond his expectation.
The Hebrew prophets intended to do honour to Moses, by predicting a
successor who should resemble him&mdash;a Messiah great in virtues,
powerful in wealth, and terrible to his enemies. These prophecies,
however, produced altogether a different effect from what they
expected; a number of ambitious demagogues having embraced the

the coming <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63" name=

civil convulsions which lasted until the entire destruction of the
ancient republic of the Hebrews. Jesus Christ, more subtle than the
prophets who succeeded Moses, predicted that a man of this description
would appear&mdash;the great enemy of God&mdash;the favorite of the
demons&mdash;the aggregation of all the vices and the cause of all the
desolation in the world. After such a splendid eulogy, one would think
that nobody could resist the temptation of calling himself
<i>Antichrist</i>; and I do not believe that it is possible to discover
a secret equal to it for eternalizing a law, although there can be
nothing more fabulous than what we read of concerning this pretended
Antichrist. St. Paul says that he was a ready born; whence it follows
that he must have been on the watch for the coming of Jesus Christ:
nevertheless, more than sixteen years rolled on after the prediction of
the nativity of this formidable personage, without any one having heard
of his appearance. I acknowledge that some have applied the terms to
Ebion and Cerinthus, two great adversaries of Jesus Christ, whose
pretended divinity they disputed. But if this interpretation be the
meaning of the Apostle, which is far from being credible, the words
referred to must point out a host of Antichrists in all ages&mdash;it
being impossible that truly learned men should think of injuring the
cause of truth, by declaring that the history of Jesus Christ was a
contemptible fable,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1347src" href=

<p class="par first">We find nothing more divine in the morality of
Jesus Christ than what can be drawn from the works of ancient authors;
for this reason, perhaps every text in his code of morals is either
borrowed from their&rsquo;s or is an imitation of it. St.
Augustine<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1367src" href="#xd21e1367" name=
"xd21e1367src">18</a> acknowledges that in one of the so-called heathen
writers, he discovered the whole of the commencement of the gospel
according to St. John. We must remark also, that this apostle was so
much accustomed to plunder others, that he has not scrupled to pillage
from the prophets their enigmas and visions, for the purpose of
composing his Apocalypse. Again, whence arises that agreement between
the doctrines of the Old and New Testament and those of Plato, unless
the Rabbis and others who composed the Jewish Scriptures had stolen
from that distinguished man. The account of the creation of the world
given in his <i>Timaeus</i>, is much more satisfactory than that
recorded in the book of Genesis; and it will not do to say that Plato,
in his tour through Egypt, had read the books of the Jews, since, by
the confession of St. Augustine, king Ptolemy had not ordered them to
be translated till long after the philosopher had left the country.</p>

alludes in his dialogue on the immortality of the soul. The idea of
&ldquo;Original Sin&rdquo; is taken from the account of Pandora&rsquo;s
box; and the interrupted sacrifices of Isaac and of Jephtha&rsquo;s
daughter are borrowed from that Iphigenia, in whose room a hind was
offered up. What we read of concerning Lot and his wife, is nearly the
same as that which fabulous history informs us occurred to Bancis and
Philemon. The histories of Perseus and of Bellerophon are the
foundation of Michael and the demon whom he vanquished. In short, it is

<p class="par first">With respect to Jesus Christ himself, Celsus, by

owing to the sect of the Pharisees, to which he belonged, that his
followers believed in the immortality of the soul, the resurrection,
and the torments of hell; and also in the greater part of his
morality,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1414src" href="#xd21e1414" name=
"xd21e1414src">23</a> the whole of which I find in Epictetus, Epicures,
and a few others. This last mentioned philosopher was referred to by
St. Jerome, as a man whose virtues ought to put the best Christians to
the blush; and whose mode of life was so temperate that a morsel of
cheese, with bread and water <span class="corr" id="xd21e1425" title=
"Source: constitued">constituted</span> his highest repast. Leading a
life so frugal, this philosopher, heathen as he was, declared that it
was far better to be unfortunate and gifted with reason, than to be
rich and opulent without it; adding, that wealth and wisdom were rarely
<span class="corr" id="xd21e1428" title="Source: fond">found</span>
united in the same individual, and that it was impossible to enjoy
happiness or contentment unless our conduct were guided by prudence,
justice and honesty, which are the qualities whence flow all true and
lasting enjoyments.</p>
<p class="par">As to Epictetus, I do not believe that there ever
existed a man, not even excepting Jesus Christ, more firm, more
self-denying, more equable, or who at any time gave forth to the world
a more sublime system of morality. Were it not that I should exceed the
limits which I have prescribed to myself in this treatise, I could
recount many beautiful <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67"
name="pb67">67</a>]</span>traits in his character; but the reader must
be contented with one example. When a slave to Epaphroditus, a captain
of Nero&rsquo;s guards, his master took the brutal fancy to writhe his
limbs, Epictetus, perceiving that it gave the monster satisfaction,
said with a smile, that he saw clearly that the joke would not end
until he had broken one of them, which happened accordingly. The
philosopher with the same equanimity and the same smile, merely said,
&ldquo;Did I not tell you that you would certainly break the
limb?&rdquo; Where is there on record another instance of like
firmness? How would Jesus Christ have acted in the
circumstances?&mdash;he who wept and trembled at the least alarm, and
who in his last moments exhibited a pusillanimity altogether
contemptible, and which was never shown by the martyrs for his
faith.</p>
<p class="par">If the work which Arian wrote concerning the life and
death of our philosopher had been preserved, I have no doubt that we
would have been in possession of many more examples of his equanimity
than we have at present. I know that the priests will speak of the
example which I have instanced, as they speak of the virtues of
philosophic minds in general, and assert that it is based on vanity,
and that it is by no means what it appears to be; but I know also, that
those people are accustomed to speak <i>ex cathedra</i> whatever suits
their purpose and to think they sufficiently earn the money which is
given them for instructing the people, by declaiming against every man
who knows what sober reason and real virtue are. Nothing in the world
can be less in congruity with the actions of these superstitious men
who decry them, than the manner of the truly learned. The former,
having studied for no other end than to obtain a place to give them
bread, become vain, and congratulate themselves when they have obtained
it, as if they had arrived at the state of perfection; whereas it is
nothing else to them than a state of idleness, pride, voluptuousness,
and licentiousness,&mdash;a condition in which the great majority of
them hold in no respect whatever the maxims of that religion which they
profess. But we will leave these men, who have not the remotest
conception of real virtue, and examine the evidences for the divinity
of their master. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68" name=

<p class="par first">Having considered the politics and the morality of
Jesus Christ, wherein we find nothing so useful or so sublime as we
find in the writings of the ancients, let us now consider if the
reputation which he acquired after his death be a proof of his
divinity.</p>
<p class="par">The generality of mankind are so much accustomed to what
is irrational, that it is astonishing to find people endeavouring to
draw a rational inference from their conduct. Experience teaches us
that they are always running after shadows, and that they neither do
nor say anything betokening common sense. These fanatical notions on
which they found their belief will always be in vogue, in spite of the
efforts of the learned who have invariably set themselves against them.
So rooted are their follies that they had rather be crammed with them
to repletion than make any effort to be rid of them.</p>
<p class="par">It was to no purpose that Moses boasted that he was the
interpreter of God, and attempted to prove his mission and his
authority by extraordinary signs. If he absented himself for a short
time (as he did occasionally, to hold conference with the Divinity, by
his account, and as in like manner did Numa Pompilius and many other
legislators), it was only to find on his return strong traces of the
worship of the gods whom the Hebrew people had seen in Egypt. It was in
vain that he had led them for forty years through the desert, that they
might lose recollection of the <span class="corr" id="xd21e1450" title=
"Source: divinites">divinities</span> which they had left behind. They
had not forgot them, and they always wished for some visible symbol to
precede them, which, if they had got, they would have worshipped
obstinately, at the risk of being exposed to extreme cruelty.</p>
<p class="par">The pride-inspired contempt alone which led them to the
hatred of other nations, made them insensibly forget the gods of Egypt,
and attach themselves to that of Moses. They worshipped him for some
time with all the outward observance of the law; but with that
inconstancy which leads the vulgar to run after novelty, they deserted
him at last to follow the God of Jesus Christ. <span class=

Moses&mdash;such also were they who ran after Jesus Christ; and their
name being legion, and as they mutually supported each other, it is not
to be wondered at if this new system of error was widely circulated.
The teaching of these novelties was not without danger to those who
undertook the task, but the enthusiasm which they excited extinguished
every fear. Thus, the disciples of Christ, miserable as they were in
his train, and even dying of hunger&mdash;(as we learn from the
necessity under which they were, together with their leader, of
plucking the ears of corn in the fields to sustain their
lives)&mdash;these disciples never despaired till they saw their master

every place, and persecuted by the Jews, who were eager to treat them
as they had treated their master, they wandered into the neighboring
countries; in which, on the evidence of some women, they set forth the
resurrection of Christ, his divinity, and the other fables wherewith
the gospels are filled.</p>
<p class="par">It was their want of success among the Jewish people
which led to the resolution of seeking their fortune among the
Gentiles; but as a little more knowledge than they possessed was
necessary for the accomplishment of their design&mdash;the Gentiles
being philosophically trained, and consequently too much the friends of
truth and reason to be duped by trifles&mdash;the sectaries of Jesus
gained over to their cause a young man<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1465src" href="#xd21e1465" name="xd21e1465src">24</a> of ardent
temperament and active habits, somewhat better instructed than the
illiterate fishermen of Galilee, and more capable of drawing audiences
to listen to his talk. He being warned from heaven (miraculously of
course), leagued himself with them, and drew over some partizans by the
threat of &ldquo;fabled hell,&rdquo; (a plagiarism from the ancient
poets), and by the hope of the joys of paradise, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href="#pb70" name="pb70">70</a>]</span>into
which blessed abode he was impudent enough to assert that he had at one
time been introduced.</p>
<p class="par">These disciples then, by strength of delusion and lying,
procured for their master the honor of passing for a god&mdash;an honor
at which, in his life-time, Jesus could never have arrived. His destiny
was no better than that of Homer, nor even so good; inasmuch as seven
cities which had despised and starved the latter in his lifetime,
struggled and fought with each other, in order to ascertain to which
was due the merit of having given him birth.</p>

<p class="par first">It may be judged now, from what has been advanced,
that Christianity, like every other religion, is only a complicated
imposture&mdash;the success and progress of which would astonish the
inventors themselves, could they revisit this world. Without
bewildering ourselves, however, in a labyrinth of error and
contradiction, such as we have alluded to, we go to Mahomet, who
founded his law on maxims entirely opposite to those of Jesus
Christ.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Scarcely had the disciples of Jesus Christ torn
down the Mosaic fabric for the purpose of establishing Christianity,
when men, led by force of circumstances, and influenced by their usual
inconstancy, followed the new legislator, who had elevated himself by
means similar, as far as possible, to those which Moses employed. Like
the Jewish lawgiver, Christ usurped the title of prophet, and
ambassador of God; like him he pretended to perform miracles, and took
advantage of the passions of the multitude. He soon found himself
escorted by an ignorant populace, to whom he explained the new oracles
of heaven. These miserably misled people, from the promises and fables
of this new impostor, spread his renown far and wide, as having
eclipsed all his predecessors.</p>
<p class="par">Mahomet, on the contrary, was a man who did not appear
at all competent to lay the foundation of an empire. He was
distinguished neither as a politician nor a philosopher: he
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href="#pb71" name=
"pb71">71</a>]</span>could neither read nor write.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e1489src" href="#xd21e1489" name="xd21e1489src">25</a> At first
he exhibited so little firmness, that he was frequently upon the point
of abandoning his enterprise; and he would have done so, had it not
been for the address of one his followers. When he was rising into
celebrity, Corais, a powerful Arab chief, being irritated that a man of
yesterday should have the boldness to mislead the people, declared
himself his enemy, and attempted to thwart his designs; but the people,
believing that Mahomet had continued intercourse with God and his
angels, supported him till he had an opportunity of being avenged upon
his adversary. The tribe of Corais was worsted; and Mahomet seeing
himself surrounded by a host of fanatics, thought that he stood in no
need of a coadjutor. However, lest Corais should expose his impostures,
he took the initiative; and to make sure, he loaded him with promises,
and swore that he only wished to become great in order to share with
him that power, to the establishment of which he might so much
contribute. &ldquo;We can agree,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;when we reach
our proper elevation; we can depend, in the meantime, on that great
multitude whom we have gained over, and it only remains that we make
sure of them by the employment of that artifice which you have so
happily invented.&rdquo; At the same time he persuaded him to descend
into the Cave of Oracles. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href=
"#pb72" name="pb72">72</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">This was a dried-up sunk well, from the bottom of which
Corais spoke, in order that the people might believe that it was the
voice of God declaring himself in favour of Mahomet who was in the
midst of his proselytes. Deceived by the blandishments of the leader,
his associate regularly descended into the well, to counterfeit the
oracle. Whilst Mahomet was passing one day at the head of an infatuated
multitude, they heard a voice, which said&mdash;&ldquo;I am your God,
and I declare that Mahomet is the prophet whom I have appointed for all
nations; he will instruct you in my law of truth, which the Jews and
Christians have altered.&rdquo; For a long time the accomplice played
this game; but at last he met with the blackest ingratitude. The voice
being heard, as usual, proclaiming him an inspired personage, Mahomet
turned to the people, and commanded them, in the name of that God who
had recognised him as his prophet, to fill up the well with stones,
that it might be an enduring witness in his favour, like that pillar
which Jacob set up to mark the place where God had appeared to
him.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1512src" href="#xd21e1512" name=
"xd21e1512src">26</a> Thus perished, miserably, the chief who had most
contributed to the elevation of Mahomet. It was upon this heap of
stones that the last of the three most celebrated impostors established
his religion, and so solid and stable is its foundation, that after the
lapse of twelve hundred years there is little appearance at present of
its being overthrown.</p>

<p class="par first">In this way was the power of Mahomet established;
and he was more fortunate than Jesus, inasmuch as he lived to see the
wide diffusion of his doctrines, which Christ on account of his want of
resources, was unable to do. He was even more fortunate in this respect
than Moses, who from excess of ambition brought himself to a premature
end.&mdash;Mahomet died in peace, and loaded with blessings. He had,
moreover, a well-grounded hope that his religion would last, because it
was accommodated to the nature of a people born and brought up in
ignorance; an adaptation in which men more learned than himself, but
less accustomed to associate with the lower orders, might have entirely
failed. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73" name=

pretended that the soul is a spirit or immaterial essence; others have
maintained that it is a part of the Divinity; others assert that it is
the concord of all parts of the body; and some uphold that it is the
most subtle part of the blood, separated into the brain, and thence
distributed through the nervous system. If this is established, the
soul must take its origin from the heart which creates it; and the
place where it exercises its noblest functions must be the brain, as
that organ is the most purified from the grosser parts of the

<p class="par first">Pythagoras and Plato have both maintained the
doctrine that the soul was immaterial in its nature; that is, a being
existing without aid from the body, and capable of action uncontrolled
by any thing corporeal. They hold that all the individual spirits of
animals were emanations from the universal Soul of the World, and that
these off-givings were incorporeal, immortal, and of the same nature as
the pervading Essence itself. They illustrated their doctrine well, by
the analogy of a thousand little lights which are all of the same
nature as the great flame at which they were kindled.</p>

<p class="par first">These philosophers believed that the universe was
animated <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77" name=
"pb77">77</a>]</span>by an immaterial Essence, immortal and invisible,
knowing everything, and acting always; and which is the cause of every
movement, and the origin of all spirits, these being merely emanations
from it. Then, as spirits are very subtle, they cannot unite (they
observe) unless they can find a body subtle as the light, or as that
expanded air which the vulgar take for heaven. They therefore assume a
body less subtle, then another somewhat gross; and thus by degrees they
come to be enabled to unite themselves to the bodies of animals, into
which they descend as into dungeons or sepulchres. The death of the
body, according to them, is the life of the soul, which was in a manner
buried, and could only in a feeble way exercise its noblest functions.
At the death of the body, the soul shakes off materiality, comes forth
of its prison-house, and unites itself to the Soul of the World from
which it emanated.</p>
<p class="par">According to this opinion then, all the spirits of
animals are of the same nature; and the diversity of their functions
and faculties arises solely from the difference of the bodies into
which they descend.</p>
<p class="par">Aristotle supposes an universal intelligence, acting on
particular intelligences, as light acts upon the eye; and that as light
renders objects visible, so does this universal intelligence render the
others intelligent.</p>
<p class="par">This philosopher defines the soul as that whereby we
live, feel, think, and move; but he is unsatisfactory as to the nature
of that Being which is the source of its noblest functions. It is
needless, therefore, to search in his writings for a solution of the
difficulties which exist upon this subject.</p>
<p class="par">Dicearchus, Asclepiades, and Galienus, have also, to a
certain extent, believed that the soul was immaterial, but in a
different way from that already alluded to. They suppose that the soul
is nothing else than the harmony of all the parts of the body: that is,
the result of an exact blending of its elements and disposition of its
parts, its humours, and its essences. Thus, they say, as health is not
a part of that which is healthy, although it is connected with it, so
neither is the soul a part of the animal, although it be within it, but
simply the harmony of all those parts which go to form the containing
body. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href="#pb78" name=
"pb78">78</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">On these opinions we must, remark, that their defenders
believe in the immateriality of the soul on self-contradictory
principles; for to maintain that, the soul is not a body, but merely
something inseparably attached to a body, is to say that it is
corporeal. We not only term that corporeal which <i>is</i> a body, but
everything which has form and accident, and which cannot be separated
from matter.</p>
<p class="par">Such are the opinions of those philosophers who maintain
that the soul is incorporeal or immaterial. We see that they are
discordant and contradictory to each other, and consequently little to
be heeded as points of faith. We now come to the opposite party, who
have upheld the doctrine of its materiality.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Diogenes believed that the soul was composed of
air, whence he deduces the necessity of respiration. He defines it as
an air which passes through the mouth into the pulmonary vessels,
whence it becomes warm, and whence it is distributed to every part of
the system.</p>
<p class="par">Leucippus and Democritus assert that it is fire, and
that, like fire, it is composed of atoms which readily penetrate all
parts of the body, and communicate motion to it.</p>
<p class="par">Hippocrates said that it was composed of water and of
fire. Empedocles thought that it was compounded of the four elements.
Epicurus believed with Democritus that the soul is composed of fire,
but he adds that there enter into its composition, air, a vapour, and
an indescribable substance, which is the principle of thought. Out of
these four different substances he makes to himself a very subtle
spirit, pervading all the body, and which, he says, we ought to term
the soul.</p>
<p class="par">Descartes reasons also, but in a very wretched manner,
that the soul is not material. I say in a very wretched manner, for
never did philosopher reason so badly on this subject as did this great
man. Here is his argument. He sets outs by saying that he must doubt in
the existence of his own body, believing that there exists no such
thing as a body at all, and then he reasons in this fashion:
&ldquo;There exists no body; I exist nevertheless: I am therefore not a
body, and consequently I can only be a substance which <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href="#pb79" name=
"pb79">79</a>]</span>thinks.&rdquo; Although this fine reasoning
destroys itself sufficiently, I will yet take the liberty of giving my
opinion of it in two words.</p>
<p class="par">1. The doubt which M. Descartes assumes is indefensible;
for although one may sometimes <i>think</i> that he does not
<i>think</i> that he has a body, it is true nevertheless that he
<i>has</i> a body, since he <i>thinks</i> of it.</p>
<p class="par">2. Whoever believes that there exists no body, ought to
be well assured that he is not one himself; for no one can doubt in his
own existence. If he is assured in this matter, his doubt is
useless.</p>
<p class="par">3. When he says that the soul is a substance which
thinks, he tells us nothing new. Every person agrees in this; but the
difficulty is to <i>ascertain the nature</i> of that substance which
thinks, and in this respect M. Descartes is no wiser than his
predecessors.</p>

<p class="par first">That we may not go crooked as he has done, and
that we may form the soundest conception possible of the soul of all
animals, without excepting man, who is of the same nature, and who only
exercises different functions from the difference in his organization,
it is important to attend to the following remarks.</p>
<p class="par">It is certain that there exists in the universe a very
subtle fluid, a substance extremely attenuated, whose source is the
sun, and which <span class="corr" id="xd21e1712" title=

according to their nature and their consistence. Such is the soul of

distributed to all the creatures in the universe.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1715src" href="#xd21e1715" name="xd21e1715src">1</a></p>
<p class="par">This soul is the purest fire. It burns not of itself,
but by different movements, which it communicates to the particles of
other bodies into which it enters, it burns and makest its warmth be
felt. Our visible fire contains more of this matter than air; air, more
than water; and earth, considerably less than any of them. Plants have
more of it than minerals, and animals more than either. In fine, this
fire <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80" name=
"pb80">80</a>]</span>pervading the body renders it capable of thought,
and is that properly termed the soul, although it sometimes receives
the appellation of <i>animal spirits</i>, which permeate the whole
body. It is certain therefore that this soul being of the same nature
as that of animals, is annihilated at the death of man, as it is at
that of the other creatures. It follows that whatever poets and divines
have told us of a future state, is only the chimerical offspring of
their own brain, begotten and nourished by them for purposes which is
by no means difficult to fathom.</p>

they denied that they were corporeal existences, or that they were
coloured or figured; adding that they could clothe themselves with air

men. A second class assert that they were animated bodies, but that

They established this belief in spirits under the name of religion,
hoping that the dread of these invisible powers which the people would

their dogma, they classified those spirits or demons as good and bad;
the one species being intended to stimulate men to the observance of
their laws, and the other to act as a check and prevent their breaking

<p class="par">To ascertain what these demons really were, it is only

passed by means of their colonies into Asia, Egypt, and Italy. In this
way the Jews, who were dispersed in Alexandria and elsewhere became
acquainted with them. They made the same happy use of them as other
nations did&mdash;with this difference, that, unlike the Greeks, they
did not call them demons, or regard them as good and bad spirits
indifferently. They considered them all as bad with one single
exception, to whom they gave the name of the Spirit, or God; and they
termed those men prophets who said that they were inspired by the good
Spirit. Farther, they viewed as the operations of this divine Spirit
whatever they considered as a great blessing; and on the other hand,
they looked upon whatever they thought to be a great evil, as
proceeding from some cacodemon or evil spirit. <span class=

the use of the appellation <i>demoniacs</i>, which they applied to
lunatics, madmen, furious persons, and epileptics, as also to those who
made use of &ldquo;the unknown tongues.&rdquo; A man deformed and
somewhat deranged, was said to be possessed of an unclean spirit; and a
dumb man by a dumb spirit. These words, spirit and demon, became so
familiar to them that they used them on every occasion. It follows that
the Jews believed with the Greeks, that these phantoms were neither
chimerical nor visionary, but real and substantial agents.</p>

<p class="par first">Hence it is that the Bible is filled with tales of
spirits, and demons, and demoniacs; but in no place of that book is it
said how and when they were created&mdash;an omission scarcely
pardonable on the part of Moses, who undertakes to give an account of
the creation both of the heavens and of the earth. Christ who speaks
very frequently of angels and spirits, good and bad, does not inform us
whether they are material or immaterial. This makes it evident that
both of them were ignorant of the fact that the Greeks had instructed
their ancestors in this strange belief. Were the case otherwise, Jesus
Christ would be no less culpable for his silence on the subject, than
he is for his refusal to grant to the majority of the human race, that
grace, that faith, and that piety, which he assures them it is in his
power to bestow.</p>
<p class="par">But to return to the subject of Spirits. It is certain
these words <i>Demons</i>, <i>Satan</i>, <i>Devil</i>, are only proper
names intended to apply to any obnoxious individual of our own species;
and that, at no period did any but the most ignorant believe in their
existence, either amongst the Greeks who invented, or the Jews who
adopted the terms. After the latter became infected with such notions,
they applied these words which signify <i>enemy</i>, <i>accuser</i>,
and <i>destroyer</i>, at one time to invisible Powers, and at another,
to those which are visible. Thus, they declared of the Gentiles, that
their dwelling was in the kingdom of Satan; there being none other than

substantive. We have showed before that there can be nothing more
chimerical; but although what was said might suffice to satisfy
rational men, we are not the less necessitated to add a few words, in
an attempt to convince the bigotted.</p>
<p class="par">All <span class="corr" id="xd21e1824" title=

argument; he is incontestibly the work of the great Head, and if he
continue to exist, all wicked as they represent him to be, it must only
be at the good pleasure of God. Now, how is it possible to conceive
that God would preserve one of his creatures, who not only hates him
mortally, and blasphemes him without end, but who sets himself to
seduce the friends of the Almighty for the sole purpose of mortifying
him. How is it possible, I repeat, that God can permit this Devil to
exist, who turns aside from his worship the favored and the elect, and
who would dethrone him were it in his power?</p>
<p class="par">This is what we wish to say in speaking of God, or
rather in speaking of the Devil and Hell. If God is almighty, and if
nothing can happen without his permission, how comes it that the devil
hates him, blasphemes him, and seduces his worshippers? The Deity
either consents to this or he does not. If he consents to it, the
<span class="corr" id="xd21e1832" title="Source: Devii">Devil</span> in
blaspheming him is only doing his duty, since he can do nothing but
what God wishes, and consequently it is not the Devil, but God himself
who blasphemes himself,&mdash;a fearfully absurd supposition. If he
does not consent to it he cannot be omnipotent, and there must be two
principles, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84" name=

one aiming at one thing, and the other at its direct opposite.</p>
<p class="par">To what then leads our reasoning? To this; that neither
God, nor the Devil, nor Paradise, nor Hell, nor the Soul, are such as
religion has represented them to be, and as most reverend divines have
maintained. These latter sell their fables for truths, being people of
bad faith who abuse the credulity of the ignorant by making them
believe whatever they please; as if the vulgar were absolutely unfitted
to hear the truth and could be nourished by nothing but those
absurdities, in which a rational mind can only discover a vast of
nothing, and a waste of folly.</p>
<p class="par">The world has been long infected with these most absurd
opinions, yet in every age men have been found&mdash;truth-loving
men&mdash;who have striven against the absurdities of their day. This
little treatise has been written from like motives, and in it the
lovers of truth will doubtless meet with some things satisfactory. It
is to them that I appeal, caring little for the opinion of those who
substitute their own prejudices in place of infallible oracles.</p>

<p class="par">The <i>De Tribus Impostoribus,</i> or &ldquo;Treatise on
the three impostors&rdquo;, is a unique book. Unique in that it was
known, heavily criticized, and banned, but never read, half a
millennium before it was written. Its title alone was enough to arouse
rage and anger with religious institutions, as the three impostors the
title refers to are Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad. Anger for calling the
founding figure of their religion an impostor, and, maybe even worse,
for equating him with the founding figures of competing creeds. Its
mythical nature meant it couldn&rsquo;t be attacked on its content and
was untouchable for even the most sophisticated apologist. It was only
in the early 18th century&mdash;the time of the
enlightenment&mdash;that some freethinkers took up the challenge and
actually produced a book under this title. This book is a kind of a
mystification, pretending to be the medieval book so many religious
leaders have fulminated against. Who has done it, and its history is
still something of a mystery. The original book was in Latin, but
translations in French, and German also appeared. Two English
translations where made, one in 1846 and one in 1904. This edition is
based on the 1846 edition, which includes quite a long introduction.
Georges Minois gives a fascinating account of this work and its history
in his 2012 book <i>The Atheist&rsquo;s Bible: The Most Dangerous Book
That Never Existed.</i>.</p>

***** This file should be named 50534-h.htm or 50534-h.zip *****
This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:

Produced by Jeroen Hellingman and the Online Distributed
Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net/ for Project
Gutenberg (This file was produced from images generously
made available by The Internet Archive/American Libraries.)

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

    Chief Executive and Director

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
